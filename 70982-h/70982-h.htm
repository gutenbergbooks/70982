<small>THE AWAKENING OF THE CRUISER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="right"><i>From Paris to Toulon, end of July, 1914.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">FROM the corridor I watch through the windows
the swift receding of Paris. In this
express-train, the last to run according to
the normal schedule, are numerous naval officers
en route for Toulon. Some have broken their
brief vacations; almost all are returning on leaves
of absence from their studies. The call of our
country sends us towards the sea, that field of
battle which we have chosen. To the French
Navy belongs the “honor” of the Mediterranean,
and our fleet is at its summit of preparedness. We
know that the decisive duel will be fought in the
fields of Flanders or on the slopes of the Vosges.
But our effort will not be useless. We have only
one fear—that we shall arrive too late, and miss
that battle which our imaginations have pictured
without actually believing.</p>

<p>Dijon, Lyons, Valence, Marseilles. I have just
left a Paris full of excitement, where life is of so
poignant a sweetness that the people are eager
to defend the happiness they possess in such
abundance. I am traveling through our smiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
France. How many times, as I have passed
from one seaport to another, on my way from a
Chinese to an Atlantic cruise, have I not understood
the envy which is directed towards her!
How could our neighbors help casting towards
this delightful land the glances of beasts of prey!
Now they have spread out their claws, and
hurled at her a cry of war. France has drawn
herself erect. Everywhere squads of sentinels
are guarding the roadways, the crossings, the stations,
all the nerve-centers of mobilization. Into
the eyes of the French people these last few days
has come a magnificent expression; a new
visage, which our race has put on as if for a fête,
gives a family likeness to all its members. The
foster-mother of children like these is no moribund
being such as the Germans think they will
succeed in doing away with. She has just felt
again the vivid sense of her duty, and the heirs
of her wonderful past draw from her strength
attitudes so natural that they are not even astonished
at them. This astonishment they leave to
the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Dijon, Lyons, Valence, Marseilles, Naguére. I
amuse myself with observing the various types
and accents of the provinces. To-day everyone
speaks the same language, has the same expression;
in every breast is the same heart. I know
that in the West, in the regions I have not
traveled through, Gascons, Normans, and Picards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
are feeling and acting alike. Among these troops
assembled on the platforms of the stations, in
the sleeping cottages of remote countrysides, in
the towns past which glides our flashing train,
there is only one dream. This dream I know, for
it is my own:</p>

<p>“What post does France give me for the great
combat? Wherever it may be, whether I fall, or
whether I survive, it will be well.”</p>

<p class="right"><i>Toulon, 1 August.</i></p>

<p>Alas! Several hours have passed, and I find
that all is not well. The vessels of the “naval
army” have their staffs of officers completed, and
from hour to hour await the order to put to sea.
I was assigned to the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>. At another
time I should have been proud to be a part
of this splendid vessel. But she is not prepared
to leave port. In an accident at sea some months
ago, she ripped herself open on the shoals of the
Gulf of Juan. The healing of great ships is a
tedious affair, and in a repair basin the engineers
are still treating her gaping wounds. In reply to
my anxious questions, I am told:</p>

<p>“The workmen are busy on her day and night.
In six weeks she will take the water again.”</p>

<p>Six weeks! And the other night on the train
I saw myself already at sea, my vessel en route
for her assigned zone. And now I must be satisfied
with a cruiser that will not stir for six weeks!</p>

<p class="right"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span><i>2 August.</i></p>

<p>We lived in an atmosphere heated by the sun
of Provence. Arriving from Paris as I did, I
was questioned. Circles formed, strangers consulted
me. In vain did I relate what I had seen
in the North, describe my journey on the railway;
these listeners only half believed me. In the
climate of Provence care disappears; my questioners
shook their heads. One regretted his
ruined vacation; another doubted my testimony;
some of them invoked the prudence of the Powers,
and concluded:</p>

<p>“Everything will end in a ‘Congress of Algeciras.’”</p>

<p>Far removed from the vivid Parisian energy,
I felt myself overcome by the enervation of
Provence. The whole drama of the week took
on the guise of nightmare. I was annoyed that
the great convulsion, ordered by Fate, seemed
once more delayed by man. I reproached my
prudent friends for not taking their part in it.
Before them the curtain of an epic drama was
already rising, and they were not hailing with
enthusiastic acclaim the opening of the spectacle.
Their mediocre souls were merely taking up again
the thread of their daily preoccupations!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Towards two o’clock I cross the threshold of
the arsenal gate, to pay the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>
my visit of embarkation. The sky is pouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
down an avalanche of dusty heat. In such an
oven no one can think vigorously. Sprawled
against the walls, the arsenal workers are mopping
their faces and chests, and, at the end of
their tether, are drinking greedily at the roadside
bars. Several officers, handkerchiefs in hand,
are walking along the rows of plane-trees.</p>

<p>The commander of the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> receives
me:</p>

<p>“You are in luck,” he says. “All the officers
who arrive at the port ask for the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>.”</p>

<p>He guesses the question I dare not utter.</p>

<p>“The engineers are counting on six weeks....
Let us hope nothing decisive happens at sea ...
in case events are so precipitate....”</p>

<p>Thinking over these words, I return to the gate
of the arsenal. It is getting on towards five
o’clock. The flame and shimmer of the afternoon
light are marvelous. The Pharon, a mirror of
stone, reflects the dazzling violet rays. It is the
hottest part of the day. After this will follow
cooling breezes. In front of the Missiessy gate
mothers and wives crouch on the sidewalk, awaiting
their sailors, who come out of the arsenal
raising clouds of dust. A beverage-vender calls
his wares in a nasal voice; several barkers offer
for ten centimes a hundred attractions in the way
of café-concerts; the tramcars, caparisoned in
dust, go by in a torrid blast. It is so warm, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
boulevard is so torpid, that I cannot think, and
have but one swift desire—to change my stifling
uniform for a more comfortable suit, and on a
terrace to sip some cooling drink.</p>

<p>Suddenly, smothered by the distance and the
heavy air, a dull cannon shot strikes into the
fringe of my reverie. I fear I have heard amiss.
I wait motionless, my whole body concentrated in
my hearing. The boulevard seems petrified.
With a brusque jamming on of brakes, the tramcars
grind along the track; the windows bristle
with anxious faces. The women squatting on the
sidewalk silently rise; barkers and passers-by
forget to live; everyone, in the posture in which
the vague shot has surprised him, listens to the
dramatic silence. All the noises of the city, the
deepest as well as the shrillest, vanish into nothingness
to leave room for the one sound that has
significance. In a sort of religious atmosphere
the second shot booms and rolls, sonorous, the
master of Space.... At length the third dies
away, the third voice of a France who is placing
herself on guard.</p>

<p>At the same time, over the deserted roadway,
the trumpets sound from the barracks. Listen to
those majestic singing tones, which bring tears to
the driest eyelids! It is the call of France!
Drawn up under the great trees a whole wan city
salutes two little soldiers who swell their cheeks
upon the shining trumpets. They are much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
affected, these two little soldiers in fatigue uniform;
their step is hesitant, and their breath
breaks. But their eyes are sparkling, each
measure brings new vigor to their step, they find
the theme again, and without taking breath they
sound the “générale” out to the suburbs, to the
slopes of the Pharon, to the roads of the countryside
roundabout. They are the heralds of their
country.</p>

<p>At this instant all over this land the same
trumpet is being blown. It has found me in a
warm and fragrant province, but everywhere
millions of reapers, with suspended sickles, are
listening to the same notes flung out over oceans
of grain. Mountains and valleys give back its
echo to the huts of cattlemen and shepherds, and
the silent waters of the rivers quiver as they
receive its melody. For the first time in the
course of the centuries the race of France is
listening at the same instant to a voice which
orders her to face towards a common point.
Stirred by a great hope, her hearts are celebrating
together this first communion of heroism.</p>

<p>Fortune compels me to wait six weeks before
playing my rôle. My weapon of war is not yet
ready. I can only admire, as a spectator, deeds
in which I have no share.</p>

<p>In the streets leading to the harbor, the heart
of Toulon, swarm crowds of people. I am not
acquainted with these figures that slip along beside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
me, but I recognize them all. Marines from
Brittany, blue-eyed, with swinging step, white-coiffed
wives on their arms; sailors of Provence,
brown and eloquent; thick-set Basques and fair
Flemings—all these men whom I have commanded,
managed, loved, hasten along their way.
A kind of enchantment dilates their eyes, a sort
of innocent ecstasy. They go gaily towards the
sea and the combat, towards their constant mistress
and their unknown bride. Already the
squadrons have steam up; a forest of stacks vomit
streamers of smoke which portend adventurous
cruises. They get under weigh to-night; perhaps
to-morrow the great adventure will occur. The
sides of the ironclads and cruisers in the roadstead
let loose a flock of boats and launches to
seek on the quay their loads of brave marines.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Around the approaches to the wharves it is impossible
to move. There is a suppressed shuffling
of feet; only jackets and uniforms can get through
to the boats. I slip in. On the sidewalk a Breton
woman is weeping softly into the corner of her
apron; her four little children, lost in the forest
of legs, press round her skirt, clutching the cloth
with their fingers; heads turned upward, they
watch through great limpid eyes the endless flow
of people. Each step reveals a similar scene;
women clasp for the last time their beloved son,
lover, or husband; their frail arms cannot let him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
go, and their tongues are stammering inexpressible
things. Yet, as I listen, I hear in all this
chorus of despair not a single word of revolt.
These women comprehend everything. They nod
their heads approvingly at the words of those
who are leaving them. Their last kiss holds even
a smile, a heavenly smile, which the fighting man
is to carry with him on the sea, and recall at
the instant of death. But when the sailor has
disappeared toward the boats, the smile slowly
fades; the women bite their lips, their faces grow
distorted, and the tears, more sublime for having
been held back so long, trickle through lids which
for many months will not cease to weep.</p>

<p>As becomes naval tragedies, the farewell took
place in a splendid setting. The twilight was
glorious with an incomparable splendor of sky,
and the purple evening seemed to vibrate in
unison with the city. On the edge of the quay,
between the boats and the crowd, I could watch
the faces, both of those who had to stay behind,
and of those who were leaving. As long as the
sailors were forcing their way along between
those parting embraces and the boats, they were
pale beneath their tan, and only with difficulty
restrained their sobs. But hardly had they
jumped to the benches of the launches, hardly had
their comrades greeted them with hearty blows
on shoulders and hips, when their color returned,
their mouths let forth sonorous pleasantries, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
they thought no more of anything but the sea and
the adventure.</p>

<p>At my feet hundreds of sailors are laughing
and singing; they intoxicate themselves with anticipation
in order not to betray their tenderness
and their grief. On the quay, overshadowing this
gayety, stands a forlorn crowd; those in front
smile vaguely, but those behind are silently choking
back their tears. And over there in the gold-flaked
roadstead, the gray ships sparkle in the
setting sun. All faces turn towards them. They
are the geniuses of the moment. Entrusted with
a portion of the honor of France, they await their
orders. Before their prows, the country has
swung open the gates of glory. Their guns and
their sailors are made of the same steel.</p>

<p class="right"><i>3 August.</i></p>

<p>In the morning I went with some friends to
the top of Cape Capet to see the departure of
the “naval army.”</p>

<p>On the <i>Courbet</i>, flagship of the commander-in-chief,
the admirals had assembled in a night council
of war. A few hours later, in the deep silence
of the blue morning, the squadrons began to move.
One after another, they took position and formed
before our eyes; we heard the faint sound of
orders. On the heavy water the ships moved without
an eddy; squat, slender, or graceful, battleships,
cruisers, or torpedo-boats fell into well-ordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
formations, and quietly took their proper
distances and intervals. They reminded one of
ancient gladiators stripped naked for the combat.
During these last days they had sent back to the
land-stores all the superfluities of peace; they
had kept only the bare necessities in rigging and
boats, and the paint on their steel sides had disappeared
under the hand of the scraper.</p>

<p>Their only ornament is the curling smoke which
rises through the still air and mingles on high in
an immense cloud modeled by the faint breeze.
Their only paint is the light flashing on port-holes
and brass. Their only finery, the guns, well-cleared,
with mouths pointing out to sea. They
are beautiful and they are invincible. Designed
for battle and the chase, they push their bows
through the water they know so well, on their
way to carry to enemy shores the frontier of
France. At the hour when human beings are still
asleep, they go to take possession of the field of
battle.</p>

<p>Their task is various and hard, and without
any doubt destined to remain unappreciated. On
the sea the paths are innumerable, and the legends
of the sea tell of many a patient cruiser that
has rarely been rewarded by a battle.</p>

<p>The transports have to carry to France our
troops from North Africa. To the “naval army”
belongs the duty of protecting these lives. No
one can tell whether or not this enterprise will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
be successful. Let a single transport fail the summons,
and a deluge of sarcasm will fall upon the
fleet of war! Let sharpshooters and Algerian
cavalry within fifteen days show their mettle in
the valleys of the Vosges, and who will give thanks
to those who had protected their dangerous
voyage? No matter! France has distributed the
tasks among her children. To the fighters on the
frontier falls the honor of crushing the Germans;
to the sailors, the silent guard of the sea.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, these too will not be denied
the glory of battle. At the foot of the Adriatic,
Austria maintains a fleet that without doubt will
try to rob us of our empire of the Mediterranean.
To release her shores she will offer us a naval
engagement. The fleet of France will prove itself
no less worthy than the army; and its deeds,
less decisive than those of Alsace and of Flanders,
will yet prove that the flag which flaps at the stern
of her ships is without stain.</p>

<p>Au Revoir!</p>

<p class="right"><i>Eve of departure, 5 September.</i></p>

<p>The crew and staff of the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>
are stirring to snatch a day, an hour, from the
delay of her departure; already we have gained
two weeks.</p>

<p>Stretched on its granite rests, the cruiser
resembles some metal giant harnessed with
machinery. With a great pounding of hammers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
the cohorts of expert workmen are putting life
into the great hull. Each day the Depot sends
us marine reservists, with instructions as to the
posts and offices where they are to labor and to
fight. A thousand men are assembled now, and
the engineers have given the ship over to us.</p>

<p>Shining and new she floats. Like a thoroughbred
that after a sickness breaks her own record,
the good cruiser has gained some tenths of a mile
on her old speed. The steam runs freely in her
arteries, the electricity through her nerves. From
bow to stern a hundred and fifty meters of steel
are aquiver. Off the Hyeres Islands, on a fine
August day, the voice of her guns, so many months
silenced, resounds again in celebration of her
recovery. Woe to anyone who passes within
ten kilometers of our cannon!</p>

<p>From hour to hour, little by little, officers and
men extend their control of the vessel, and get
better acquainted with her mazes. As their skill
becomes surer, they adapt themselves to the
particular moods of the ship, and to her caprices,
which can only be mastered with prudence and
with affection.</p>

<p>Our crew, an amorphous crowd collected at
random from the four quarters of France, had
lost that sense of discipline and responsibility
which the humblest of sailors should have. We
have had to drill them, direct their discordant
forces, and make them a living being animated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
by a will. Each one in his place now applies his
intelligence and his strength to his special task,
and tries to get himself into trim. Time presses.
In a few days we have put new life into the great
torpid cruiser. After a few hours we shall depart,
nor shall we cut the figure of poor relations or
of cripples in the “naval army.”</p>

<p>Thank heaven, the decisive action has held off.
We dread the telegram announcing an encounter
of the fleets; but it has not yet come. Opening
the chapter of Mediterranean events, the <i>Breslau</i>
and the <i>Goeben</i>, German cruisers, have attacked
Algerian ports, and fled towards the Dardanelles,
where a miracle has turned them into Turks. Here
is game for a later time. In the middle of August
the French navy has sunk the <i>Zepta</i>, a small Austrian
cruiser. But that’s a minor affair. We
shall arrive in time.</p>

<p>On certain evenings we go to sleep on land.
Friend of those who frequent her, the sea is
execrated by the women who live on her shores;
their mourning is harsh and bitter. War adds
tenfold to their anxieties. Our comrades who left
at the beginning of August suffered an uprooting
that was short and sharp. We, who have remained
too long, run the gamut of anxious concern.
For those men from my cruiser who meet
feminine affection on shore, each moment holds
an unknown torture. Between a sob and a caress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
passes the phantom of naval hecatombs. Beneath
his lowered eyelids the sailor sees his future
glory, but the arms clasped about his breast are
an embrace of despair. A sunset, a walk between
dusty hedges or over fragrant grass—everything
suggests agitation and dread. Eye and ear acquire
a mysterious perceptivity. One longs to
retain, like a viaticum, the voices of loved ones
in their most inconsequential inflections. We can
bid farewell to France, for the treasures of our
hearts have been wrung dry.</p>

<p>To this feeling the sadness of the news from
the front adds poignancy. When in the morning
the officers study the map of operations, brought
up to date according to the communiqué, a profound
silence falls over the salon of the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>.
We cannot believe this sweep over
Belgium, this tidal wave over the French
provinces. We wish to depart, to do no matter
what, to work, to die. Under our feet the cruiser
trembles, our own child, our friend, our master.
Each hour of delay irritates us. We are indifferent
about the road to victory. Painful and
tragic as it is, all Frenchmen accept it, and the
sailors about to leave cherish no other thought.
The other day, while a crew of gunners were
loading shells charged with melinite, I overheard
this exclamation from a man whose brawny arms
held a yellow projectile:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“Gawd! Why don’t they just use shells stuffed
with sawdust? It wouldn’t take any more than
that to give them theirs!”</p>

<p>I doubt if this war will be won in so childish
a manner. But it is pleasant for an officer to command
such children.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PART II<br>

<small>IN THE ADRIATIC</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="right"><i>Adriatic Sea, 25 September.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE ships keep shelter in Pola and Cattaro,
and will not come out! There is nothing
Austrian in sight except the names on the
maps and the silent coasts. We continue, however,
to sail along the shore, we brave their submarines,
their mines, their torpedo-boats. Like
the knights of the Crusades challenging their adversaries,
we go to offer ourselves to their attack.
But they do not issue forth.</p>

<p>Like a great army corps that waits the engagement,
the armored squadrons run the barrage of
Otranto. They are the lions of our naval
menagerie. Claws sheathed, jaws closed, they
strain their ears for the call of the cruisers....
In small groups the torpedo-destroyers circle
round them, sweeping the road where the great
beasts of battle are about to pass, and watching
to see that no submarine is prowling on the path.</p>

<p>Further north on the skirts of the Adriatic
great-lunged battleships are holding the jungle.
The cruisers know no rest; they pursue their
anxious watch along the outposts, traversing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
waves and piercing the sky. Upon their observations,
in sun and shadow, depends the safety of
the great battleships. Theirs is the joy of spying
the enemy upon the horizon, of rushing forward,
of receiving the first shots and launching the first
shells, of so calculating the retreat as to draw the
enemy within range of the battleships’ guns.</p>

<p>We are three brothers—the <i>Ernest Renan</i>, the
<i>Edgar Quinet</i>, are as beautiful and majestic as
the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>. Their six stacks belch
forth the same clouds. Engaged in the same work,
all are acquainted with the same fatigue. Older
and less sturdy, the <i>Gambetta</i>, the <i>Ferry</i>, the
<i>Hugo</i>, and the <i>Michelet</i> have the same tasks.
Their family is known by its four smokestacks.</p>

<p>From Otranto to Fano, and along its whole
shadowy line, the seven cruisers blockade the
Adriatic at the end of which the Austrians are
entrenched. From the summit of the bridge one
can see for ten miles; that is why we navigate
at twenty miles’ distance, on circuits of short circumference,
ever the same. The cruisers never
sight each other, but each knows that below the
horizon a brother ship is within reach and on
guard. Sometimes the ceaseless rhythm of their
march brings them to the confines of their “beat,”
and they sight each others’ masts glistening on
the horizon like the bayonets of a double sentry.
Then both tack about, and go their opposite
directions; the masts sink out of sight, the smoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
drifts away, and nothing is left but a solitary
vigil on a deserted sea.</p>

<p>Since our departure from Toulon the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>
has been in constant motion. In the
waste of waters the clamors of the world are
stilled. We have commenced the pilgrimage
known to so many generations of sailors. At a
venture we halt some small game—packet-boats,
three-masted schooners, or steamers, which submit
to our examination. They bring us a faint
echo of human affairs—Italians, Greeks, or
Spaniards—and are fraught with I know not what
continental aroma. We send these timid travelers
on their voyage; their examination is but play;
the important affair lies up there at Pola or Cattaro.
Every week after coaling—which we do at
sea—we go and shake our fists at the enemy, crying
shame upon him in his retreat and challenging
him to an encounter. Many times already we
have gone up there in the night; in the daytime
we have circled about Lissa, the Dalmatian Isles,
and even further still. Far behind us the battleships
follow, alert for the signal—“Enemy in
sight!” But our guns are leveled in vain; in vain
our eyes face the tracery of sun and shadow.
Nothing appears within our range except the
motionless shores, the slumbering isles—never a
quarry.</p>

<p>This disappointment does not slacken our
vigilance. In times of peace a single lieutenant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
aided by an ensign, suffices for the many duties
involved in managing a ship. Whether it has to
do with observing the heavens, avoiding collisions,
or coordinating the movements of many hundreds
of sailors, during his four hours’ command he can
easily attend to and handle it all.</p>

<p>Those times are no more. War puts a tenfold
burden upon the cruiser without adding to its
staff of officers. For now the ship is at once an
organ of navigation and an instrument of battle.
This duality of function demands at every moment
two directing heads; the first continues to
direct the watch, the second assumes responsibility
for the lookout, defense, and battle. On the
<i>Waldeck</i> we have only six lieutenants; so we form
three crews of two each, who relieve one another
on the bridge in an endless round, by day and
night, in all weathers. One of them looks after
the route, the crew and the signals from the
shores; the other keeps his eye upon the sea and
is ready at any moment to let loose the guns. My
rank of seniority gives me the second rôle.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the war, whether it be
short or long, my mate and I are destined to the
same changes of fortune. He must have my confidence,
and I his. These things are not uttered.
But they are implicit in our handshake at the
moment when we take the watch and assume the
precious charge of the ship for our four-hour
period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>He is a Fleming, I am Latin. This difference
extends even to our ways of thinking, and lends
piquancy to our two daily meetings. As we lean
on the bridge rail, he at port and I at starboard,
we watch the sea with equal vigilance. But in
our secret souls move thoughts which have nothing
to do with our profession. This is one of the
privileges of men of action. They can surrender
themselves wholly to their task without ceasing to
dream of a thousand things. My comrade and I
talk in low voices. The war, Germany, the future,
everything comes up in these murmured conversations.
We do not believe in keeping silent, for
our motionless position is likely to bury us in a
dangerous torpor. As our eyes search space, we
passionately discuss the great drama, and we
never agree. But if, in the treacherous night, a
shadow appears, or a suspicious shape, suddenly
we are one. Each performs instantly the necessary
rites; one commands the helm and the
machinery, the other directs the primers and
gunners. The two of us in the darkness cooperate
perfectly.</p>

<p>And then a few minutes later the scare is over.
The gunners resume their posts, the primers unprime
the guns. We two officers—one on the port,
the other on the starboard—continue our vigil and
our whispered talk.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span><i>Adriatic Sea, 27 September.</i></p>

<p>Three English cruisers—the <i>Cressy</i>, the <i>Hogue</i>
and the <i>Aboukir</i>—have just found their last resting-place
in the North Sea. Still intact, but bearing
in their sides torpedo-wounds, they have
slipped into their winding-sheet of sea-weed,
where the skeletons of vessels sunk in ancient
wars await them. The sea-water, that patient
embalmer, will reclothe their keels with a shroud
of rust and lime. On bright days, when the sun
shines on the still sea, they will see the shadows
of living vessels pass overhead. They will be
caressed by the ripple from those screws, and
their petrified hulks will quiver with pleasure.
During the tedious hours of the lookout, I have
been meditating upon the wireless messages which
announced the death of the <i>Cressy</i>, the <i>Hogue</i>,
and the <i>Aboukir</i>. That same tragedy may cut
short the very phrases which I am commencing
to unite. I imagine the whole scene, I recreate it.
I have sailed the North Sea, I have lived two
years in a submarine, and I am at war now on
a cruiser.</p>

<p>I see three ships, somber and silent like ourselves,
following the course laid down by the
Admiral. North and south, other patrol vessels
are traversing the appointed routes. While the
soldiers of France and the children of England
sleep, the sailors are keeping watch on the sea,
that no one may force the barriers of their countries.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
But the sea is illimitable, the cruisers are
few and far between, and cannot lend each other
aid. For this the sailor must make up in toil
and weariness; he takes less sleep, he watches
unceasingly, he is always cold, he never touches
land. Up there, just as in the Adriatic, he mounts
his guard, longing with all his heart for an
adventure.</p>

<p>Thus sailed the <i>Cressy</i>, the <i>Hogue</i>, and the
<i>Aboukir</i>, how many days I do not know. But I
do know the vigilance, the labor, the self-sacrifice
of their crews. More than all the others, they
offered their souls to the service of victory—these
sailors whose ships are decorated with the famous
names of English victories. These three noble
names, did they not foretell a new harvest of
laurels? Did they not symbolize a return to more
fraternal policies, which dedicated to the service
of France these namesakes of French defeats?
English officers and sailors, with the clear instinct
of men participating in great deeds, should offer
France, in a single victory over our common
enemies, a recompense for these three disasters
England had inflicted upon her!</p>

<p>This night passed like all the others. Along
the horizon were trails of gray light. The rolling
sea emerged from the chaos of dawn, and the
lookouts, with heavy heads and quivering eyelids,
scanned for the thousandth time the troubled
awakening of the North Sea. They saw nothing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
Perhaps one of them had descried a streak of
foam whiter and clearer than the rest, and quickly
raised his glass to his eyes. But the streak of
foam had already been covered again, and he
dropped the glass which had not revealed the
periscope. The three cruisers pursued their way
amid the ridges of foam, one of which, though
they were unaware of it, meant death to them.</p>

<p>A shock went through the first ship. The sailors
on deck thought there had occurred an accident to
the machinery; those below thought that a gun
had been fired.... Everyone listened. Under the
brave fellows’ feet the ship turned, lazily at first,
while the waves boiled impatiently about her.
Then they understood, all of them; they knew that
death was near. Before they sank into the sailors’
grave, they looked again for the enemy who had
destroyed them without granting them the joy of
battle. Their staring eyes fell upon their comrade
of the patrol, and filled with fear, for the <i>Aboukir</i>
was lurching too. Both had been stung to death
by the stealthy advance of the submarine vipers.
Generous still in their very death-agony, the two
wounded ships hoisted warning signals, that their
comrade might evade the deadly track. But she,
as generous in her pity, raced to save the lives
of the sailors in the engulfing waters. She too
received her mortal wound, without being able to
fire a single gun, although, clearer-sighted in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
face of death, she was able to discern the submarine
under its white streak of water.</p>

<p>As the chill of the hemlock poison rises to the
heart, the water rose in the three ships. The
boilers choked with it, the machinery was
drowned; one by one the watertight compartments,
exploded by the pressure of the waves,
burst with the noise of thunder. The electricity
failed everywhere at once, and the sea became
a tomb where men struggled and were buffeted
by the waves. On the deck, drawn up in line, the
crews gazed straight into their doom. The triple
choir raised a hymn which they had learned on
their English Sabbaths, and they sank to meet
their God.</p>

<p>Farewell, sailors of the three cruisers, fallen
perhaps through the same fate that is in store
for our Adriatic cruisers! Your anguish, your
vigils, your last thoughts, we feel here on the
<i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>. Your end was noble, even if
no one around me envies it. For we pray the God
of Battles, if he sends us death, that we may at
least exact a heavy toll from our enemies!</p>

<p class="right"><i>Strait of Otranto, 8 October.</i></p>

<p>How can one describe the atmosphere of the
Adriatic? For that marvel our most delicate
adjectives are inadequate. It is more than
diaphanous, better than translucent; it dreams.
It seems to exist only to contain pure color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>How many times has this immaterial air deceived
the officer of the watch! How many miles
away is a certain steamer? In how many hours
shall we skirt the island that rises amid the
clouds?</p>

<p>Formerly we solved these problems without
thought, for our eyes had learned to gauge the
density of the air and its deceptions. The Adriatic
atmosphere has lowered our conceit. Skies
or sails, lighthouse or shore, each object is always
further off than we suppose. Prudent now, we
hesitate to say whether Corfu is thirty miles
away, or that this pale line of the Otranto coast
is not a cloud resting on the water. We are not
wrong to mistrust ourselves. Corfu is fifty miles
away, and this imagined cloud is the coast of
Italy.</p>

<p>The officers on the bridge struggle with these
illusions. The sea itself multiplies their difficulties.
Formerly the sailor dreaded only what
moved above the surface of the sea. He noticed
at almost any distance traces of smoke, indistinct
masts, and all the signs by which a ship reveals
her presence. But the sailors of to-day level their
gaze upon that surface which was once so innocent....
Between two crests floats a dark
speck.... Is it not a mine charged with explosives?
Those shining lines, like the trail of
a snail, are they not the oily tracks of a submarine
lying in wait for us?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>But sailors learn secrets. Formerly, they contemplated
the waves and ripples carelessly, as
queer old comrades whose every mood one pardoned.
But now they keep them under a stern inflexible
eye. The play of a wave, the alternate
strips of light, the shadows of a cloud—we
grapple with everything, and never relax our
vigilance. For everything is illusion.</p>

<p>The lookout wavers between a fear of being
ridiculed and a fear of having seen amiss. There
is never a day that some wireless message does
not come from one of our sentinels of the sea,
telling the “naval army” that a submarine is in
sight. From Saint Maure to Lissa, from Tarento
to Corfu, all the French ships are anxious about
the outcome of this encounter, and hope that the
comrade engaged will be victorious. Minutes slip
away, we imagine the whole drama; a noble envy
stirs every heart. And then the second message
comes over the sea. “It was not a submarine!”
it declares. Then the Adriatic and the Ionian
Sea resound with a burst of mocking laughter,
one of those bursts of laughter which only the
descendants of the Gauls know how to give.</p>

<p>Tragedy, nevertheless, comes close on laughter.
From the bridge the officer of the watch has seen
something, two or three miles away, that is not
quite the color of its surroundings. He fastens
his glass on this dark or light speck, which moves
slowly like a periscope on the lookout.... The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
thing disappears and reappears, like a periscope
which is taking its bearings, ordering its course,
and waiting.... The officer’s heart leaps. His
orders start the engines, direct the pilot, send the
gunners to their guns. His body is tense with
joy, his eyes shine; on the bridge, at the port-holes,
officers and sailors follow the alarm with
excited interest, and gaze out at the suspicious
speck in the distance. Everyone envies the comrades
who have charge of the ship at this brave
moment, the gunners and steersmen who will pit
their wits against the submarine. A sort of joyful
anguish grips their hearts, for it is war to the
death, and perhaps the torpedo is already
launched and making straight for the keel. We
fairly suffocate with excitement.</p>

<p>But some more experienced eye has made out
the shape. “It’s a bit of wood!” murmurs a
top-man.... “No, it’s a bottle!” whispers a
gunner. Each one gives his opinion. “It’s a seagull!”
“It’s the branch of a tree!” “It’s a
broom-handle!” “It’s a box of preserves!”
The uproar increases and rises to the officer on
the bridge, who wipes his glass in order to see
better. He is still expectant; he curses this encounter
a thousand times. He is responsible for
the boat and for all these laughing sailors. Torn
between derision and danger, he remains prudent,
and makes for the dangerous object, with the
order to open fire still on the tip of his tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>Suddenly, when we are eight hundred or a thousand
meters away, he takes a few nervous steps,
countermands the alarm, orders the engines to
slow down, and turns his eyes away from the
preserve-box, the branch, the bottle, whatever it
may be. The ship shoots by at a short distance.
The jokers in the crew salute the innocent waif
that floats past and disappears.... Unless it be
a gull, busy with its bath; in which case it dives,
preens its feathers, dives again, without bothering
about the ship, or her officer on the bridge.
Between its plunges, sunk up to its breast in the
water, it rides past the flying steel monster with
a mocking “Kwang! Kwang!”</p>

<p>At the end of his watch, the officer goes below
to the ward-room where he is received with mocking
laughter. These sorry jokes he scorns as a
stoic should. He knows that the next night or
to-morrow, at any moment, his comrades are as
likely to make a mistake as he. We had all rather
see a periscope than seagulls or branches. In the
North Sea the <i>Cressy</i>, the <i>Hogue</i> and the <i>Aboukir</i>
had seen gulls and branches a thousand times.
The day they sighted nothing they went to their
doom.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Adriatic Sea, 15 October.</i></p>

<p>The Adriatic is our private estate. The
cruisers make use of it as if Austria did not
exist. They ascend it, circle about, stop in front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
of the islands, challenge the coasts, without a
single visible enemy’s attacking them. Doubtless
the submarines come out daily from Cattaro in
quest of the prize booty that our vessels would
make. But either chance or our vigilance has
prevented the disaster. We watch, we are worn
out; nothing happens. Sometimes in the West,
low on the water, trails the Italian coast; smoke
floats over Otranto or Brindisi; for forty days
this is all we have known of human activity. The
lighthouse of Santa Marin of Leuca marks the
uttermost point of Latin soil; it is a desolate
object, like a pale needle stuck into the blue air.
By night, its light falls on the veils of the horizon.
It is one of the lonely friends of our solitude.</p>

<p>Towards the eastern coasts other friends watch
our passage—the gaunt peaks of Albania or
Epirus, or even the Ionian Archipelago, that
delicate jewel of stone. Albania and Epirus!
Famous but sinister names! Wherever Islam
rules dwells devastation. The bases of the mountains
are buried in the sea, and they look colossal;
death lives on their gray slopes. A warm sun,
however, shines on them, and busy hands may be
tending vineyards and olive orchards. Yet one
sees only masses of rocks, and the scars of mountain-streams.
Here and there a bald yellowish
circle stains the mass of stone. In that spot
flourished in former times an Albanian or Epirote
village. Fire destroyed it, and the fury of men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
has left it only a charred waste. A dizzy silence
comes from these mountains. It falls and rolls
over the blue water, so hard a blue one thinks
a hammer might strike sparks from it. No one
lives in these somber regions. Along the bays
and inlets barks with Levantine sails scud before
the wind, passing by in all possible haste. These
barks carry mountaineers crowded in their holds
like sheep in a pen. In these brigand realms life
is so unsafe that even the brigands themselves
prefer the hazards of the sea to journeys by land.</p>

<p>Our cruiser halts these tiny boats. Then the
human cargo bursts out from the hold, and their
distress shows that they think their last hour has
come. Clothed in sheepskins, armed with daggers
and pistols, these rascals conceal in their hearts
a world of unknown crime; every time they find
it profitable they are ready to massacre and betray.
Their dark minds do not know who we
are nor why we have come. We can only be
executioners, equipped with irresistible weapons.</p>

<p>The visiting officer reassures them, of course,
with his gestures. The passengers remain suspicious;
their keen eyes watch him as he points
to the holds and orders their contents turned out.
The bullies understand; we are robbers and will
let their lives go in exchange for their merchandise.
Pell-mell they throw out their
figs, their bundles of dried fish, their little
sacks of corn—wretched food of wretched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
beings. They spread them out at the foot
of this plunderer in a lace-covered uniform.
Their broken language and raised hands call
Christ to witness, or Allah, or even the Demons
of the caves, that nothing further of value is left
in the hold. The officer turns the sacks over,
opens some, for fear that cans of essence or cases
of explosives have been the object of this furtive
journey to Cattaro or Pola. His foraging fingers
encounter nothing but figs or herrings, which
leave on his finger-nails a faint spicy smell. Carelessly
he wipes off with his handkerchief the
mixed fragments of fruit sugar. With a severe
glance he makes a last inspection of the boat.
The good bandits relapse into disquietude. They
don’t understand; what does he want of them?
One of them speaks, and at once their faces clear
up. It is gold he demands, good sterling coin, an
easy ransom to carry. The richer ones extract
from their belts some pieces from the Balkan
States, much worn and effaced; the poor ones
spread out on their palms some sous and centimes,
so bent and filed they are good only for jacket-buttons
for our sailors. An old bashi-bazouk,
white around the temples and at the ends of his
mustache, has not a single good coin; crouched
on the deck, he tells over a blackened rosary and
from his god begs absolution for past sins. The
others plead; the women kiss the hands and knees
of the uniformed stranger; the children cry bitterly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
The visiting officer embarks majestically
in his long-boat, and makes a gesture of disdain
that sends all this misery on its way again. The
pilot hoists the sail, the rich man pockets his
piasters and the beggar his coppers, the bashi-bazouk
his prayers, the women their kisses, and
the children their tears. The sheet swells, and
the bark passes below the cruiser, whose crew
smile indulgently, while our Albanians and
Epirotes, seated on their hatches, understand
nothing whatever.</p>

<p>On other days our police duty takes us further
south. Steamers and sailing vessels frequent the
approaches to Corfu, and our visits are more
careful and more profitable. The shores have
lost their gloomy appearance; black herds are
pasturing on the hills; each slope is checkered in
squares of olive orchards and clusters of vineyard;
in little well-sheltered coves four white
houses are grouped round a ruined mosque.</p>

<p>On the edge of the water, overhanging a harbor,
rises the castle of some erstwhile pasha. This
castle is round, copper-colored, classic in design,
beautifully situated. The blue water reflects its
pale image, and we often slow down for the mere
pleasure of admiring it. Victor Hugo would have
loved this stronghold, whence pirates used to
surge forth, and the village where the booty was
brought together; his lines would have celebrated
the pasha-corsair, the beauty of his odalisks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
and the romance of their jeweled retreat. These
lovely walls, however, conceal tragedies of Islam.
They brood over the sea paths, and their silence
is that of a beaten vulture. I prefer to forget
that sinister grandeur. I prefer this empty silhouette,
artistically placed here in a happy setting
for the brief delectation of a few passing
sailors. These are empty pleasures, perhaps, but
we have no others.</p>

<p>Perfect hours await us at sea, off Corfu, Paxo
and Cephalonia. When the twilight unfolds its
pageant of air and light, we get a sense of joy
and confidence that sustains us in our exile. The
sun sinks in a procession of purple clouds, shading
away to a faint heliotrope in the sky overhead.
From mid-heaven hang sheafs of eglantine and
geranium, beneath which blossom red carnations,
tulips and poppies. The sun feeds all this floral
fire. Under the iridescent play of color the sea
has disappeared. Its liquid surface has merged
with the luminous air, and the cruiser, rose-colored,
moves through myriad rainbows.</p>

<p>Everything about the suspended ship is changed
to silence and fantasy. The shadows of twilight
succeed the colors that glow and disappear. Air
and sun create marvels that are not of our world.
The light falls on us like a blessing which penetrates
our hearts and thoughts with an inexpressible
ecstasy.</p>

<p>At last the sun rests on the horizon, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
slowly swallows it. Our sad thoughts are drawn
toward the West, towards France. For some of
us that sun is gilding the faces of loved ones and
caressing the windows of our homes; for others
it is glimmering in the tearful eyes of a sweetheart.
From our lips, like a messenger of feelings
that cannot be written, its beams carry our kisses
to lay on other lips.... But it also sweeps over
fields bathed in the pure blood of our soldiers—and
the thoughts of these “vagabonds” it bears
onward toward their spoil.</p>

<p>Certain evenings, while the glorious sun is thus
bearing away our dreams, the moon, languorous
and discolored, rises laboriously over the Ionian
Isles, and offers us her pale rays. But we
do not look at her. For her sickly light, her
capricious form, her pilgrimage among the
shadows—all serve to remind us too painfully of
the obscurity of our own labor, the uncertainty
of our thoughts and the memory which our work
will leave behind us to the ages.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Strait of Otranto, 18 October.</i></p>

<p>Day before yesterday the “naval army”
gathered at the rendezvous appointed by the
Admiral off Fano. It was a warm, clear day. The
sea seemed asleep; light clouds came and went
in the sky. From all directions gathered the
squadrons, the divisions, and the separate vessels.
Slow and thickset, the ironclads rose over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
horizon and moved down upon us. Round about
them destroyers performed evolutions like greyhounds
frolicking round a hunter. From Italy,
from the Ionian Isles, raced black-striped cruisers,
swift and graceful, plowing up the foam; they
had left their monotonous patrol guard to join
the French cohorts about to ascend the Adriatic.</p>

<p>At the rendezvous, crouching like a beautiful
tiger in repose, and covered with flags and
pennants, the <i>Courbet</i>, the Admiral’s vessel,
awaited the others. Breathless they paused beneath
her gaze, and received their final orders.
From the bridges of the <i>Courbet</i>, the signalmen,
with movements of their arms, sent preliminary
instructions to each ship; the many-colored
signals ascended and descended the halyards.
Boats and launches left the ships and hurried to
the Admiral from whom the officers received long
closed envelopes which they quickly carried back
to their ships. The commanders opened them,
bent over maps and plans, and divined the wishes
of their chief.... Every week since we left
Toulon this has been the episode which interrupts
our tedious voyages. After it is over, our “naval
army,” numerous and impressive, again breaks
up. One after another, the ships begin to churn
the purple water, taking their proper posts and
lines, and dispersing towards their regular night
routes. The Admirals lead their squadrons and
divisions; long dim streaks in the sky, far apart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
indicate the tracks of our departure, but the fickle
sea effaces all its lines. Towards the North, losing
itself in the distance, the immense procession
moves on to offer a tournament of battle. It
stretches out the length of a province. Behind,
and at a great distance from each other, the
armored squadrons move at a slow and steady
pace. At the head, offering their breasts, deploy
the cruisers, sweeping the Adriatic. Ahead of
them there is nothing but emptiness.</p>

<p>The <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> advances in the night.
Tense with watching, she trembles in the darkness.
All the ports, all the scuttles are closed, and not
a particle of light betrays us. The fires are controlled,
so that they throw off no sparks or cinders.
Absolute silence prevails. Our invisible progress
makes no more sound than the flight of a night-bird.
It is my detachment which has the first
watch.</p>

<p>There is a certain powerful excitement in concentrating
all one’s energy in ear and eye, in
restraining the desire of the blood for sudden
action. My comrade to port, I to starboard, do
not stir. If our fingers mechanically touch our
eyelids or scratch our itching neck, our intent eyes
never waver. They see nothing but blackness.
The light of the stars is veiled in a thin mist, and
there are no reflections on the water. We move
in a darkness as of the tomb. Thus, in the forest,
animals creep along on guard, bending the weeds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
and crawling through the brush they do not even
rustle. Our engines and screws drive us along,
supple and furtive like groups of cats. Our prow
cuts the water without stirring it.</p>

<p>Of this cautious being, my comrade and I are
the temporary brain. Around us perhaps lurk
Austrian destroyers, also invisible and silent,
which may be launching at us, as they pass, their
pointed torpedoes. Before we have suspected
that death prowls there, they will have perceived
a gigantic hulk making a spot in the darkness.
Let the two officers on watch, safeguarding the
ship, have a second of forgetfulness or fatigue,
and a thousand men may be lost in the abyss
whence none returns. In us these thousand
sailors place implicit confidence. If disaster
should happen, they would forgive us in their last
agony, because they know that no human power
could have prevented it. Presently, when we lie
down on our bunks, worn out with the strain, we
shall deliver our lives over to our successors without
a thought. The two watchers on the bridge
are the guardian angels of the crew.</p>

<p>That is the greatness of our vocation. Nowhere
in this war, in which the battlefields will have
seen so much heroism, will there be a heavier task
imposed on leaders of men. No general or sergeant
could commit a mistake which would annihilate
his army or his squad in a single instant.
The ball kills only one man, the shell carries off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
only a file; and the mine spares those at a distance.
Every fighter on land has his chance of
surviving the worst disaster, and the most careless
officer will never have upon his conscience
the death of all the men he has commanded.</p>

<p>But a boat is a prison, more confining than
stones and bars and chains; we are suspended
over the abyss. Naval catastrophes are like a
vomit from hell; no other catastrophe crushes so
many lives at a single stroke. Lives and goods
lost together! Terrible words, which cannot be
said of cataclysms on land. Earthquakes, fires
leave reminders, ruins, witnesses of that which
was.... But the ocean tears from her surface
a handful of metal and men, and sends them to
rot in her bowels. And the next day the unchangeable
deeps smile their eternal smile.</p>

<p>Long ago the sea knew the whole art of murder.
Our diabolical genius had to add tenfold to the
horror. Human ingenuity has invented the mine,
more remorseless than a hundred reefs; the
torpedo, more destructive than a hurricane, and
those explosives which tear to pieces still living
tissue into projectiles of flesh.</p>

<p>The slow night ebbs away. These forebodings
of the fate of sailors invade the souls of the
watchers, and make them long to vanquish the
specters of the shadow. For to die is nothing if
one has been able to save others. From the interior
of the ship, from the hammocks and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
posts of the watch, rises the voice of a hundred
trusting hearts. That unity of appeal creates
this thing which has neither form nor law, but
which draws its strength from the very depths of
the soul, in that affection, that complete devotion
of oneself: Duty.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Tedious as are the hours filled with such distressing
thoughts, the night, nevertheless, finally
begins to fade. The East pales and the mists
disappear and unveil the depths of the sky, where
a few faint stars go out one after the other before
the approach of the sun. The light slowly conquers
the limits of space, and sea and ships take
on form and substance. From the South a cruiser
emerges, gray as the waves through which it
comes, the dawn strips it of its veil, moulds its
shape, reveals the masts and the smoke from its
stacks. Farther away there is a row of motionless
points on the surface of the water; these are
the masts of the ironclads that have followed on
our track. Others still farther South are entirely
invisible.</p>

<p>The mountains of Austria and Montenegro take
possession of a segment of the sky; their white
peaks have a scarlet hem. They form a wall
stretching from North to South, of which the
ravines, the escarpments and the summits are still
buried in mist. Our cruiser gets orders to bear
farther northward, while the other cruisers deploy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
between it and the ironclads. It puts on
speed, its whole bulk quivering under its armor.
When it has taken position, it can still see its
neighbor in the South, and the stacks of the ship
behind it. But only puffs of smoke reveal the
presence of the other ships, of which the most
distant is opposite Antivari or St. John of Medua,
fifty kilometers away.</p>

<p>The entire “naval army” bears off to the right
and moves toward the enemy coast, which every
moment renders clearer. I take the watch, which
has been resigned before midnight. A few hours
of uneasy sleep have left me with the taste of
ashes in my mouth, and a painful fluttering in my
eyelids. But have we not all lived in this way
for I know not how many weeks? And should
one not whip up his blood in the face of approaching
danger? And can one stay drowsy in the
marvel of this dawn?</p>

<p>Here is light in all its purity and perfection.
The blue of a young girl’s eyes, or the delicate
green of April meadows, seem gross and hard in
comparison with this light. It is quiet, yet alive
with beauty. It enchants like a perfume; it evokes
a solemn rapture. Surely the robes of angels
must be woven from rays of such light.</p>

<p>But from behind the mountains the sun rises.
Objects appear more clearly and lose their
delicacy of line. Far to the North over the Dalmatian
Isles a few clouds stain the sky. The haze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
is lifting from the bay of Cattaro, the details of
which we study through our glasses—gray spots
of forts, white streaks of lighthouses, smoke of
Austrian ships sheltered in the roadstead. Above
the town, which is still invisible, slowly rises a
black point like a dark bubble; I watch this suspicious
ascension, but cannot yet make out what
it means. On the other side the sun hangs on
the summit of a mountain.</p>

<p>All the air seems to vibrate. One’s eyes are
dazzled at such refulgence, such clearness. The
sun frees himself from the mountain peaks, and
as he rises pours down a triumphal torrent of
light. The Dalmatian Isles, the Austrian coast
rise suddenly, imposing and menacing. The
cruisers to the South reflect a radiance from their
hulls, the sheet of sea over which our cruiser
advances alone is covered with a glassy surface
which the eye cannot penetrate. With their hands
on the mortar, the gunners stand stiller than ever.
In the bow of the ship the sailors who do not
belong to the watch keep their eyes on the approaching
land and the gliding sea. The ascending
black point has stopped, and seems held at
the end of a line. Now I recognize it for a captive
balloon. Its casing, its cording, looks as transparent
as a spider’s web. But from its height
a human eye has observed us; the submarines and
destroyers have been warned by telephone; and
all is astir, in this inaccessible arsenal, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
effort to attack, without danger to themselves,
the cruiser that offers them battle. In the
splendor of the still morning, this captive balloon
symbolizes the troubled passions of men—murder
and destruction. But it is delightful to approach
the enemy through all this enchantment. Under
the sunlight the sea has become blue and seductive
again, and the death of the cruiser, should it occur,
will take on a sort of divine beauty in this
brightness.</p>

<p>Things begin to happen. Out of the last bank
of mist which stretches along the coast there
mount in spiral flights two almost imperceptible
insects. At so great a distance they resemble two
animated bits of dust. They are Austrian aeroplanes
seeking the height and the currents of air
favorable for attack. They see the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>,
lost in the sea-mist, and instantly
separate, one drawing northward, the other southward.
In a few minutes their outlines are hidden
in the clouds, and we no longer know what has
become of them.</p>

<p>Soon the Montenegrin post of Lovcen signals us
by wireless that the harbor of Cattaro is astir.
A squadron of torpedo-destroyers is getting up
steam. Some ironclads are moving, submarines
are making for the channel outlet. Forewarned,
the watchers on the bridge, sailors and officers,
gaze at the narrows, and soon discern on the surface
of the water some fine bluish tufts like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
smoking butts of cigarettes. It takes the acute
vision of seamen to distinguish them, for we are
sailing more than twenty miles from shore. They
are two submarines coming out of Cattaro and
preparing to submerge. The brightness of the air
is enough to dazzle us. And then we see nothing
more. These metal fish are buried under the
waves, taking unknown paths, and moving mysteriously
towards us who are their prey.</p>

<p>All eyes on the bridge are fixed upon the scene.
We approach danger with clear vision and mind
and with a quiet pleasure. On the forward deck
the marines not on duty scrutinize alternately the
horizon and the faces of the officers on watch to
make out what adventures they hold in store....
Among the winding straits of Cattaro glide masts
as fine as hairs; these are the destroyers which
in their turn are issuing forth to attack us. The
<i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> keeps on toward the hostile
coast. At last the first destroyers appear, gray,
and plumed with smoke; the moment has come to
prepare ourselves for battle, and the commander
orders the trumpets sounded to clear the decks
for action.</p>

<p>At the first notes of this music which they have
heard so many times for mere drill, the sailors
prick up their ears and cast questioning glances
at the bridge. Voices are raised asking nervously:
“Is it in earnest this time?” With an affirmative
nod I reassure them. A joyous clamor rises from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
all their hearts, the clamor of children who are
at last going to play. In an instant everyone has
rushed to his post of battle. The decks are deserted,
the ship is abandoned.</p>

<p>But in its bosom a hidden life goes forward.
The port stanchions are closed; the powerful
bolts, which the men hastily shoot, make out of
the enormous hull a hive partitioned by steel. In
every cell of the hive groups of men, sometimes
a single man, look after the apparatus, set it working,
and wait. They see nothing, and will see
nothing. If the ship is conquered, they will not
know how or why. Everyone is silent. Where
soldiers in the great moment of battle translate
their joy of action into shouting, sailors, on the
contrary, must keep absolute silence. Only the
rattle of the engines, the telephone orders, and
the trumpet calls may be heard. In the turrets
and the casemates, behind the guns, the gunners
and pointers hold themselves motionless, ready
for the swift, precise movements, repeated so
many times in innumerable drills, which will send
straight to their mark the rain of well-aimed
shells.</p>

<p>From the guns, the engines, the helm, the mute
tension of a thousand men flows back to the turret,
the brain of a cruiser. In this armored enclosure
are stationed the commander, his two officers in
charge of the firing, his navigating officer. They
know that the safety of the ship depends on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
clearness of their judgment. With lowered voices,
as if they were conversing on matters of no importance,
they address sailors who transmit their
orders. Crouching before the artillery keyboard,
a few men manipulate the fly-wheels, the bells and
signals which tell the orchestra of guns their distances,
correct their aim, give them orders to
fire. Behind the three dials which direct the engines
three sailors quickly write the orders. To
right and left, mouth and ear to a line of telephones
and speaking trumpets, two sailors listen
to the word from below and reply. With his hand
on the lever of the steering-gear, and his eyes
on the compass of the route, an impassive petty-officer
executes the orders of maneuver. There
is no noise except the slight grating of the rudder
indicating each degree to starboard or port.
Through the horizontal embrasures of the turret,
like the narrow iron-barred slits in the helmets
of knights, the four officers survey the horizon.
They make out the churning of foam from a
periscope which is moving toward the cruiser’s
starboard at top speed. Instantly the whole volley
of light guns opens fire on this enemy; the
rudder is turned to starboard to change the course
of the cruiser, deceive the submarine, and attempt
to ram it.... Almost at the same moment there
appears from the clouds to the northward an aeroplane,
which descends towards us like a water-spout,
and wheels about, trying to get a long-distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
aim. Our sharpshooters cover this enemy
of the air, and their shots crackle above us like
drums. As soon as we are close enough to fight
the charging destroyers effectively, our heavy
guns open a steady fire on them. Our cruiser becomes
a mass of smoke and noise as it confronts
the triple peril of air, surface and deep. Every
man works with the precision of a clock. I cannot
begin to enumerate all the episodes of these exciting
moments....</p>

<p>Three hundred meters above us, the aviator lets
loose his bombs. Their fall makes a noise like
the rending of a sheet of iron. But the turn of
the cruiser to starboard has defeated the precision
of his aim. Near our hull, fore and aft, they
burst with an uproar which deadens the voice of
the guns; bits of them rebound to the decks and
turrets, and around the spot where they have exploded
the sea quivers as if it had been peppered
with a hail of pebbles. The aviator mounts higher,
pursued by our sharpshooters, who, however,
soon abandon him.</p>

<p>Despite the turn to starboard, the cruiser
misses the submarine by a few feet, and it disappears
beneath the water. The sailors below
hear a rippling and lapping of water pass along
the hull; they even think they feel the impact of
a solid object which scrapes the keel without being
able to penetrate it. There is very little doubt
but that the submarine did torpedo us, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
quick maneuver of the ship saved us. Instead
of hitting us squarely, and damaging our sides,
the torpedo—perhaps there were several—merely
grazed us and passed on without effect.</p>

<p>In order to see whether it has touched us and
to get another aim at us, the submarine comes to
the surface again; as it rises we see its periscope
and turret athwart us, and without delay the light
guns cover it a second time. The water boils
about it, the shells burst and envelop it in yellowish
smoke. Had it been struck? Is it destroyed?
One never knows the fate of these
enemies, which, whether victor or vanquished, immediately
submerge. The course of the cruiser
sweeps us far ahead; we no longer concern ourselves
with the submarine, which is no menace to
us now. Only our heavy guns speak.</p>

<p>At a great distance the Austrian torpedo-destroyers
are encircled by our falling shells.
But, like the snipes they are, they twist and zig-zag
on the water. We rush along at a speed of
eleven meters a second; and if our fire halts the
destroyers, it does not seem to touch them. Their
prudence triumphs over their boldness. Persuaded
that our fire will never admit them within
torpedoing distance, they describe a half-circle
and flee. In succession, like rabbits regaining
their burrow, they take shelter in the channel of
Cattaro, until we distinguish only the tips of their
masts, which recede, and disappear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>Our heavy guns next engage the coast-works,
lighthouses, or batteries, which are now in range.
Since the explosions on rocks and earth enable
us to regulate our fire, we should shortly be doing
great damage to the shore, except for a wireless
from the commander-in-chief ordering us to cease
our solitary combat. Doubtless the land forts are
waiting for us to come nearer, and their guns,
more powerful than ours, will do us more harm
than the aviator, the submarine and the destroyers
together.</p>

<p>Regretful but obedient, the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>
turns her back on the shore and moves southward
toward the waiting cruisers. In a few seconds
their distant outlines, as well as the squadrons
of ironclads, grow large and stand out in relief
against the sky. They would all have come to
our rescue if our challenge had succeeded in drawing
out the powerful armament sheltered in Cattaro.
But once more the Austrians fail to offer
battle, having attempted only to send the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>
to her death, with the smallest possible
loss to themselves.</p>

<p>While our cruiser regains her own division at
top speed, the periscope of a second submarine,
on watch in the offing, reveals its furrow of foam
on our port side. Regardless of whether it has
launched its torpedoes, we rain upon it a steady
fire from our lighter guns, not pausing to pursue
it, for the order to return is imperative. Half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
an hour later the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> slows down
and again takes her place in the line of cruisers.
Their crews look with envy upon this vessel, the
first in the naval war to have the triple honor
of facing the triple enemies of the ships.</p>

<p>Two signals are raised. We take new positions
for descending the Adriatic. In a few days we
shall come back to insult Austria, and perhaps
we shall be more fortunate. It is now the end
of a white, translucent morning. On board, the
battle organization is abandoned, the ordinary
watch resumed. While the officers and sailors on
the bridges continue to study the sea, we meet
again in the ward-room. Meal-time approaches,
no one mentions the moments through which the
cruiser has just lived. A certain officer of engineers
comes out of the boiler-room and tries
to beat his record at cup and ball, playing with
a steady hand. Four others, their ears still filled
with the roar of the guns, plunge into the peaceful
subtleties of “bridge.” Others examine maps of
Flanders and Poland.</p>

<p>In a profound calm, a kind of oblivion, we talk
of things remote from war. And when, after the
meal, the commander assembles the officers in the
saloon to celebrate in a glass of champagne their
baptism of fire, his speech already seems to call
up an event from the far past.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span><i>Adriatic Sea, 25 October.</i></p>

<p>Something dark brushes the horizon. A spot
on the sky? A storm cloud? The mirage of an
island? Our eyes do not hesitate for long; the
thing lives and breathes; it is the smoke of a
vessel. The officer on watch speeds up the engines,
changes the rudder, and points the bow
toward this smoke. Since our departure from
France not a ship, not a sail, has evaded investigation
by our cruisers and destroyers, the Argus
and Cerberus of the ocean paths.</p>

<p>Above the horizon rise the masts, the stacks,
the hull of the ship. Innocent or guilty, it knows
it cannot escape our speed, and does not attempt
to flee. At fifteen thousand meters, its outline
indicates whether it is a liner, or a freighter; at
ten thousand, its displacement shows us whether
it is loaded or carries no cargo; at five thousand,
its flag reveals its nationality. If it be English
or French, it is allowed to pass. If neutral, we
show it the signal of the international code: “Halt
immediately!”</p>

<p>It has to stop. If it shows any inclination to
pursue its way, the first blank shot warns it not
to play with fire. If it pretends not to hear this
reprimand, a shell falls in its path to inform it
that we are not joking. If it insists upon proceeding,
a few shots straight at its hull assure it that
the matter is becoming serious. It always stops in
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>The cruiser halts within range of the suspect.
In an instant one of our long-boats has been
lowered and its crew seizes the oars. An officer,
armed with sword and revolver and carrying a
big record-book, jumps into the boat, which puts
off from our vessel. A sailor accompanies him.
When the wind is rough and the sea choppy, the
boat bounds, plunges and rolls on this passage
which seems interminable; the seven sailors
struggle with all their might at the oars; buckets
of water drench the heads of officer and men; in
a few minutes they are soaked through.</p>

<p>The long-boat accosts the steamer, from the rail
of which hangs a rope ladder, sometimes merely
a knotted rope. Why are they always too short?
I don’t know. Anyway the officer, hampered by
his sword and his register, and strangled in a
uniform which was never meant for jumping,
stretches out his arms and tries to grasp the ladder.
But the swell rolls back and forth and tips
the boat. As he approaches the ship, there is the
ladder swaying two meters above him; as soon
as he is high enough to seize it, the ship lurches
off. It is like a skittish horse that refuses the
mount. At these gymnastics the passengers and
crew of the ship smile maliciously. The officer
rages. He puts his sword between his teeth, his
register between coat and shirt, waits for the
least unfavorable moment, launches himself headlong—and
grasps the ladder. For a few seconds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
he performs on this flying trapeze. A playful
wave laps his knees, his hips, his chest. Recovering
himself, he makes a few rungs, hoists himself
up the slippery ropes, throws his leg over the rail,
and at last puts his foot on the deck.</p>

<p>This adventure, thank heaven, is not always so
unpleasant! Some visits seem like pleasant
duties. But what has the bad winter weather in
store for us?</p>

<p>It would be demanding superhuman virtue from
the captains to expect them to like these visits
on the high seas. We delay them, we bore them,
and sometimes we turn them away from their
route. Ordinarily they show us a very surly face;
too polite a mien, on the other hand, is to be distrusted.
The officer readjusts his disordered uniform,
controls his ill-humor, assumes an impassive
air, and gives a military salute.</p>

<p>“Captain,” he says, “have the kindness to show
me your papers.”</p>

<p>This formula is pronounced in English,
Spanish, Italian or French. Grammar sometimes
suffers, but not all the world is polyglot. When
the visiting officer has exhausted all his vocabularies
without anyone’s understanding him, he
contents himself with a gesture, reinforced by
a contraction of his brows in the direction of his
revolver. Thereupon intelligence comes to the
most obtuse. A little procession forms. The captain
looking important, the officer severe, the commissary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
obsequious, the sailor escort bringing up
the rear; by means of the passage and stairs these
four actors in the little drama reach the navigation
room, where are kept the regulation papers.
The more luxurious liners sometimes set a table
with cigars and liqueurs in the first cabin. Such
an attention arouses double suspicion.</p>

<p>The passengers line up along the deck. This
episode makes a pleasant interruption in the
monotony of the voyage, and gives their pacific
minds a slight shuddering taste of the great war.
Every man begins to feel like a hero, and to invent
a tale which will astonish his future hearers. The
men search the face of the French officer, but read
little on this cold mask. The women, bolder,
solicit his glances, his smile, press themselves on
his attention. “Vive la France!” cries one. “He
has a real revolver!” whispers another, shuddering.
“Stop, officer, and let me photograph you!”
begs a third.</p>

<p>The visiting officer does not reply, does not
stop, but hastens on his mission. In his register
he consults the original of all the documents he
has warrant to verify; text, stamps, signatures
are exactly reproduced, and not one word of the
ship’s papers must differ from the original. If
they are in Arabic, Norwegian or Japanese, the
officer’s pencil compares them line by line. In
curt phrases he approves or objects.</p>

<p>The civil status of the ship seems correct; its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
name, its country, its record, reveal nothing ambiguous.
The captain is then questioned. Whence
has he come, where is he going, and where has
he stopped? What are the owners’ orders?
The chart and the log, the dates and hours
of calls at ports, certified by the official
authorities, are all verified. The slightest inaccuracy
requires explanations, proofs. In such
times as these, all movements at sea must be
above suspicion, and the least evasion renders
one suspect. To help his captain the ship’s commissary
bustles about, pours a glass of liqueur, uncorks
a bottle of champagne, introduces a foaming
glass between two incisive questions. But the
French officer courteously waves aside these
seductions.</p>

<p>The commissary in his turn goes on the stand;
he spreads out and explains the bills of merchandise,
illegible scrawls in every language,
dotted with strange abbreviations, with obsolete
weights and measures in the jargon of grocer and
manufacturer. Every line has them, and twenty
special dictionaries could not disclose their traps.
Like an archæologist poring over a worn stone,
the visiting officer weighs, unravels, interprets
these hieroglyphics; from a pocket-book he extracts
lists of shippers and consignees friendly to
our enemies, and inspects the ship’s papers to see
that their names do not figure on them.</p>

<p>Every bill of merchandise raises a question.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Certain cargoes always go through, others under
certain conditions, some, officially contraband, are
fair booty. The texts of the treaties of The Hague
and of London pretend to solve all these problems.
The officer consults these texts, looking for
helpful suggestions. But these treaties, drawn up
in times of peace for the despair of sailors in war,
are full of ambiguities, over which the crafty
neutrals slide. How many enigmas does not the
officer have to solve in a few minutes under the
dull gaze of his two colleagues!</p>

<p>According to such and such a paragraph the
case appears clear, but a footnote throws everything
into confusion again. There are neither
precedents nor regulations. Upon our decision
rests a fraction of our country’s honor. Too much
good nature runs us the risk of providing our
enemies with valuable materials; too much rigor
will bring vigorous complaints from injured
neutrals. Let our decision leave a loophole in the
dispute, and learned jurists will deliberate over
it in the prize-courts for weeks and months; then
will consume endless hours and heaps of paper
before discovering what ought to be the judgment
actually rendered in the interval between a
drenching in a long-boat and a submarine scare.</p>

<p>Bah! We have our privileges of State. Our
conscience is clear, our intentions are pure, and
little remorse accompanies our verdicts. Yesterday,
as well as to-morrow, we make a seizure or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
release, according to the simple dictates of common
sense. The smiles and grimaces of the commissary
do not warp our judgments; even when
the captain, at a critical moment, presses on us
a whole box of choice Havana cigars this seduction
adds not a grain to our weighing-scale. The
officer politely declines, ends his examination,
makes his decision, and demands the passenger
list.</p>

<p>“Captain, have the kindness to draw up on deck
all the persons on board. Let each one hold his
identification papers in his hand. In five minutes
I shall make my inspection.”</p>

<p>Women, stewards and waiters scatter through
the cabins, which suddenly fill with commotion.
In the midst of a chorus of exclamations, of murmurs
and laughs, feverish fingers ransack writing
cases and bags; travelers with good consciences
easily discover what they need; the women adjust
their hair, hastily powder a suspicion of tan on
their faces, and with a turn of their hand put all
the details of their toilette in order. They are
tremendously entertained. It’s like a real play!
For a very little more they would put on their
prettiest gowns.... But the officer is in a hurry,
and the captain excuses himself: one passenger
cannot lay his hand on his passports, which he has
certainly shut up in a trunk. Exactly! The story
is well-known! That bird from Germany must
be held.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>Everyone lines up in two or more rows. Irresistibly,
an order rises to the lips of the visiting
officer—“Right dress! Eyes front!” But no, these
passengers are not soldiers. And now the task is
to keep in line this fat lady in a rather short
skirt, who inserts herself between an asthmatic
youth and a rugged American. Let us stifle our
laughter! The lines sway, somewhere at the back
a boy sneezes, two Brazilians or Argentinians
burst into shameless laughter, a huge negro
trembles with fear. The officer passes on his
inspection.</p>

<p>Like a row of blind people holding out their
wooden bowls, everyone carries his passport in
his hand. The men are extremely grave, almost
indignant, and one can imagine the silent perturbation
behind their brows. They lie in wait
for an imprudent word in order that they may
at once invoke their counsel, their ambassador,
and the unwritten laws of neutrals. Vain hope!
The officer looks them over swiftly, and opens
their papers with a scrupulous touch. Stamps and
signatures are correct, the descriptions too; the
passports, the certificate of nationality, have no
taint of fraud. But no touchstone is worth so
much as that of speech: to expert ears a few words,
a few phrases, reveal many secrets, and a hesitating
manner accuses where the documents
acquit.</p>

<p>“Kindly tell me where you come from....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Kindly tell me your name and the date of your
birth.... Did you leave your country some time
ago? Kindly answer me in your own language....
What is your profession?”</p>

<p>One has to question closely and in various ways,
and keep oneself from getting into dialogues.
There is never a discussion; an immediate judgment,
and we go on.</p>

<p>Compatriots, Russians, English, undergo the
questioning. They are cheerful and anxious to
chat.</p>

<p>“In too much of a hurry, my friend!... A
handshake and bon voyage!... The last news
from the wireless?... Everything goes well,
very well!”</p>

<p>Click! Click! Right and left, the kodaks are
at work. Who will ever count the albums in which
playful passengers have put their naval inspection?
They imagine they have not been seen, but
their faces, suddenly serious, and their air of having
touched nothing, betray their crime.</p>

<p>“And you, mademoiselle? What signatures on
your passport? What journey are you making?”</p>

<p>“I am from Valparaiso, and I am on my way
to my family in Moscow!”</p>

<p>Ye gods! What are all these women doing
wandering about the vast world? Half the
soldiers in Europe have thrown themselves on the
other half, but travelers come and go like doves,
without thought of trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>The passports of the men are comprehensible—functionaries,
manufacturers going from port
to port, mobilized men, producers from the Far
East; all avow intentions which are definite and
easy to deal with. But the origin and destination
of the women are puzzling enigmas. In America,
in Asia, in Africa, all the chancelleries of remote
consulates have written over and scratched out
the most bewildering itineraries. These papers
are fantastic.</p>

<p>The mystery is increased by the contradictions
of the passengers’ appearance. The visiting
officer examines a modest passenger in tennis
shoes, flannel suit and traveling cap, who blushes
like a boarding-school miss, and answers very
timidly. And what does he see on the photograph
of the passport she shows him? A smiling doll,
buried under a hat as large as a millstone,
adorned with aigrettes and feathers; a very
elaborate arrangement of the hair which hides
half her face, and three rows of pearls on her
bare throat. Is there anything in common between
this luxurious figure and the timid person
wringing her hands in the line, whose inward
mirth appears in her sparkling eyes and an imperceptible
trembling of her elbows? He would
be a perjurer who would swear to it.</p>

<p>It is even a relief when they know their own
nationality exactly. I never suspected that one’s
native country could be mislaid, lost and found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
like a pair of gloves. But in these latitudes one
learns something every day. Wars, treaties, and
revolts, have so confused the map of the East that
it seems as if every passenger were provided with
two or three spare countries.</p>

<p>“Now, Madam, will you explain for your husband,
whom I do not understand? What is his
nationality? And you yourself, are you Turkish,
Egyptian, Greek or Russian?”</p>

<p>“It is very simple, Mr. Officer. My husband
was Armenian, that is to say, a Turkish subject.
At the time of the massacres he fled to the
Caucasus and found it wise to put himself under
Russian protection. His business called him to
Crete, which became Greek while he was living
there. I was born in Macedonia, a Turkish subject,
but the last war has made me a Serb. We
went to Alexandria because it was quieter there,
for since the English are suzerains of Egypt, we
intended....”</p>

<p>So goes the story. Adventuresses, spies, or
wanderers tossed about in Levantine eddies, their
talk is as picturesque as their papers. It would
be absurd to persecute them in this maze where
they are astray.</p>

<p>To what end, moreover? The real prize, the
choice booty, is recognized by infallible signs:
German faces, Teutonic accents, insolent or
honeyed replies, stammered explanations. However
much they may have garbled their names and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
submitted to us false ones in writing, the race
of these Germans oozes from every pore. They
are on their way to foment rebellion in Egypt
or in Tripoli; they are going to work the Balkans,
to pursue in India or China their secret intrigues.
Invariably their passports derive from Switzerland
or Holland, but their certificates of nationality,
very new, just off the press, remind one of
coins that are counterfeit and too bright. Suspects!...
The officer goes down to their cabins;
everything he finds in the valises, the steamer
trunks, denotes innocence and sincerity. But he
is nauseated by a strange odor. It cannot be
defined, but whoever has smelt it recognizes unerringly
the kind of flesh it comes from. With
handkerchief to nose; he turns over the bed and
ransacks the furniture. Under the mattress, behind
the wash-basin, in the folds of a blanket, lies
the fatal paper, the envelope or the packet....
Enemies!...</p>

<p>Now the affair must be ended decisively,
elegantly, in the French style. Invested with discretionary
powers on a neutral boat, the visiting
officer conforms to courtesies which would satisfy
the most exacting. His attitude, the tone of his
voice, his words, affirm, in surroundings often hostile,
always excited, the sovereign will of his country.
The staff-officer of the boat, the crew
and the passengers form a hostile jury of free
witnesses who would jeer to the ends of the earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
the slightest clumsiness. But we are at any rate
vain enough not to imitate the ruffianly manners
of our enemies.</p>

<p>The visiting officer stops before the German,
calls him by name, lays a finger lightly on his
sleeve or shoulder, and says, without raising his
voice:</p>

<p>“I take you prisoner. Follow my sailor, who
will carry your baggage and conduct you to the
ship’s boat.”</p>

<p>Cries, bursts of rage, insults, are of no avail.
One adds nothing. What is said is said. At the
worst, if the scene becomes painful, the officer
turns to the captain.</p>

<p>“Commandant, I direct you to use your authority
to compel Monsieur to follow me. Otherwise
I shall be obliged to use force. I take the responsibility
for the order I give you, and I will draw
up for you a report of the proceedings.”</p>

<p>That is enough. Protected by the owners
and his government, the captain abandons the
prisoner to his fate, and speeds the removal of
his baggage. The German taken in the snare
protests, sheepish and mortified. But the faithful
sailor has already seized him and is hurrying him
without much ado to the long-boat. The audience
makes comments. The kodaks work their fastest.
A few hands applaud, a few malcontents murmur.
The circle opens deferentially before the officer,
who copies on the log the formulas appropriate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
to the visit, recounts the incident, exonerates the
captain, and signs the deposition which will go
the round of the chancelleries.</p>

<p>Then, and only then, when the business is all
settled, will he accept perhaps a cigarette, or a
file of newspapers, or a cup of coffee. While the
prisoner’s baggage is being somehow tumbled into
the bottom of the long-boat, the officer takes a
few steps along the deck. The crowd of passengers
precipitate themselves upon his suddenly
humanized person. “News! News!” implore all
the voices. He repeats the wireless messages received
from the Eiffel Tower, from Poldhu, and
is careful to make no comments. As if by magic,
the misses, the donnas and senoras of all the nations
and of every type of beauty slide under his
hand a pencil, albums, post-cards. He defends
himself. They beg with alluring glances. Must
he not yield? Feverishly he scrawls, signs, dates
the cards and albums. He is promised photographs—which
he never receives. Sly scissors
clip from his coat a button to mount on a hatpin.
Families invite him to the Ukraine, to California,
to Buenos Aires, after the war is over.</p>

<p>Finally the sailor escort returns: “Ready!”
he says, saluting.</p>

<p>The officer pushes his way through the crowd,
throws his leg over the rail, commences his tumbling
descent. On the seat of the boat the prisoner,
quite still, takes up the least possible room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“You may continue your voyage!” cries the
visitor to the captain, who is awaiting his release.</p>

<p>More questions, and farewells; a waving of
scarfs and handkerchiefs. But he is already in
the hollow of the waves; he wipes the spray from
his face, and, raising his cap, makes a fine salute
of farewell to all these passengers whom he will
never see again.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the boat with its prisoner
is hoisted on board. The officer reports to his
commandant, and at once draws up his statement.
The cruiser begins to move, heading west; the
liner recedes to the south, and soon we see nothing
but her smoke. For several hours we prowl about,
expecting the same ceremony to recommence.
Five or six times a day we stop, make a visit,
permit them to go on, or show our teeth. There
are some amusing and some dramatic adventures,
but for a few profitable visits how many futile
ones there are! Yesterday in battle; always on
the watch; a beast hunting for prey; the customs-officer
of the high sea; traveling ceaselessly;
never in port—such is the lot of the cruiser. Who
of us reckoned on this as war? No one, I swear.</p>

<p class="right"><i>North of Corfu, 30 October.</i></p>

<p>Was it not a dream from which we have just
emerged? For several days—no, I must be mistaken—for
a few hours the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> has
been lying in the harbor of Malta, and our feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
have trod the ground, the shore, the sidewalks.
Fifty-three days at sea had persuaded us that
everything in the world is in motion. One has
to be a sailor to appreciate the delights of the
shore.</p>

<p>It was in fact a dream. To-night finds us again
on our patrol, between the coasts of Epirus and
Corfu. Our rest is brief, we move very slowly,
the screws seem almost asleep, and during my
watch, from ten in the evening until two in the
morning, the cruiser has slipped through magnificent
shadows.</p>

<p>This sea is too lovely. Anxious to solace our
exile with her feminine caresses, she shows us
from hour to hour a delicious and ever-changing
countenance. In moments of alarm and trial she
succeeds in pervading us with her gentle consolation.
But to-day, far from the Austrian coast,
everything seems kindly, and the sailor can
abandon himself to the magic of the shadows. Not
a sound, not a breath, in these happy moments.
Nature never slumbers so softly as on the sleeping
waves, and the most smothered words are too
noisy to express this silence. The sea opens
languorously at our prow, and receives us
amorously, so to speak, in her watery arms, which
embrace us tenderly along our hull. The reflections
of the stars, which ordinarily rock without
ceasing up and down the ridges of water, stand
motionless in it like nails of light. The coast is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
mirrored in the black element, reversed so perfectly
that the land and its image seem cut from
the same block. Epirus, Corfu and Merlera surround
us in an immense circle, enclosing us almost
as in a lake. But this lake is filled with a
limpid water that extends from the shores of
yesterday to the cliffs of to-morrow.</p>

<p>Enlarged in the transparent air, the stars seem
to have come down nearer to us; the moon does
not disturb the happy shadow. The star Sirius
rises in the heavens, detached suddenly from the
mountains like a slow rocket. She is round like
some heavenly fruit, and the beacons on the coast
are dim before this queen of our heaven.</p>

<p>On the Balkan cliff, halfway up the side of the
mountain, flames a red light. Evidently it is a
conflagration; in some little valley a wretched village
is burning and expiring. Is it Albanian,
Greek or Epirote? Some bandits with torches
have set on fire the first barn on their path;
the thatch, the mud walls, the dim huts, are consumed
in whirlwinds, and the starlight is stained
with streaks of smoke. The herds up there bleat
and bellow in the flames; disheveled mothers
carry off their nurslings; the men load their guns
and unloose the dogs. To-morrow, in reprisal,
another hamlet will be burned.</p>

<p>We are so far away, so lost in the night, that
this sinister fire does not affect us at all. Why
pity or curse, when distance smothers all sound?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
Yet how can we help being carried back to the
obsession of the war, which the sea, the sky, and
the stars, had banished from the present moment?
Have not these distant flames been lighted by the
incendiary of Berlin, and do they not portend the
track of murder that will soon soak the East in
blood?</p>

<p>But on this night I do not wish to abandon
myself to sorrow. I wish to let my whole being
slip into the rich blackness, and to ask of it the
serenity demanded for the coming danger. Before
dawn a velvety freshness creeps up, and
banishes my insidious fatigue. This freshness of
the end of night seems to make still smoother the
surface of the sea, in which are sunk the reflections
of the stars, clear, numberless, white as wax.
Sparkling above each taper, every star recalls the
flame which trembles on Christian altars at dusk,
when the tardy penitent cannot distinguish the
dim wick between the wax and the fire. Among
the unreal columns of this Adriatic temple glides
the cruiser.</p>

<p>This temple has neither nave, organ, nor pavement.
The chandeliers have burned there since
the first breath of things. The tabernacle is the
immensity wherein swing the divine planets. The
nameless architect is God, who has sown the stars
near His throne in order that the humble regard
of men shall be lifted to Him.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span><i>Among the Austrian Islands, 2 November.</i></p>

<p>It is dawn. We are moving in a long file towards
the Austrian islands. From cruiser to
cruiser the cocks are calling and answering each
other. As their clear call salutes the dawn, it is
accompanied by the cackling of our poultry-yard.
In the fresh air the melancholy cattle are lowing,
and the restless sheep are bleating; each of
our dinners diminishes their number. To the
officers on watch there rises the country smell
from the henhouses, the cattle manure, and the
hay, their fodder; and the air is filled with all the
sounds of an awakening farm. Into the preoccupations
of the watch creep precious memories
and nostalgia; one would like to be in some country
place, surrounded by meadows and woods, and
one wants to close one’s eyes so that nothing may
destroy the dream.</p>

<p>But it is the green sea that forms our meadows;
and the Dalmatian Isles, which emerge from the
mist, are the groves of our horizon. The three
big cruisers with six stacks are in the upper
Adriatic, at the approaches to Lissa, a bastion of
the Austrians on that sea, over which we sail without
opposition. Further south, toward the isles
of Lagosta or Pelagosa, the armored squadrons
move at reduced speed. Once again, the tenth or
twentieth time—we have lost count—the French
“naval army” emerges from the dawn and offers
the challenge they will not accept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>Only a short distance away, Lissa wakens under
our eyes. Pleasant wooded slopes clothe this
island; a tiny town, the principal place, surrounds
a quiet harbor. We do not need our glasses to
count the houses or even the windows; the people
who come into the streets raise their hands to
Heaven at sight of us and retreat behind their
doors, which they barricade. The ribbon of water
separating us from the shore is hardly broader
than a river, and without taking aim our guns
could pulverize houses and people. The Germans,
in our place, would assure themselves a
tremendous triumph, which their journals would
celebrate in the list of German victories. But the
French are incorrigible; they will never learn
these illustrious methods, and will never destroy
defenseless cities and men. Think what you will,
our gospel contains no such precept.</p>

<p>Our division is accompanied by two squadrons
of destroyers; they make their presence known
by doing legitimate damage. The lighthouse of
Lissa might assist the movement of Austrian
ships at night; the cable can transmit to the arsenals
news of the movements of the French fleet.
Our destroyers do not hesitate to destroy these
tools of war. Their guns thunder against the
lighthouse; their dredges search for the cable at
the bottom of the sea. To emphasize the ease
with which we approach the enemy, small French
vessels enter the harbor of Lissa with a haughty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
air. The fisherfolk and other people on the coast
are terrified; no one expects mercy; everyone commends
his soul to God. From the bridge the
officers of the cruiser observe all this excitement;
they see swarms of people fleeing into the country,
where our guns could nail them like flies against
the wall. It all makes us smile. Our sailors are
quietly washing their linen, or gaily chattering.
Like their officers, they are savoring the deliciousness
of this quiet morning, in front of this island
filled with sunlight and with terror. Their generous
souls do not desire the destruction of this
defenseless town. But at the bottom of their
hearts and their talk lies a question which three
months of naval warfare had not solved—“What
must be done to these Austrians to make them
revenge themselves? Will they make us no return
for our insults?”</p>

<p>An officer and some sailors from the destroyers
set foot on land. The population is humble and
suppliant. We ask them the names and addresses
of the two principal notables of the island, and
immediately the notables are made known to us.
No threats or revolvers! Everything goes off
admirably. The two notables are brought before
the chief of the French detachment; they tremble
at first, but the courteous firmness of the all-powerful
sailor reassures and conquers them.
When it is announced to them that the Navy will
hold them as hostages, they are not afraid to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
deliver themselves over to the good faith of men
who do not abuse the rules of war. When we
demand from Lissa a contribution of twenty-five
thousand francs, they give it themselves, in hard
cash of full weight, convinced that this gold is not
passing into the pockets of highwaymen. When
they are asked to deliver themselves up on board
the torpedo-destroyers, they are given time to
dress in their best clothes, to embrace their wives
and children, and to assure the city that the enemy
cruisers will not bombard it. In this little corner
of the world where fate confers upon us these
extraordinary powers, a few hours are sufficient
to make the people our friends. If by any chance
French victory should mean that the tricolor is
planted on this island, it will float on friendly
soil there.</p>

<p>Morning passes. Halted before the harbor of
Lissa, the three cruisers wait while the destroyers
finish their task at leisure. Midday sounds. Beyond
doubt, the Austrian bases of Cattaro, Pola,
and Sebenico have been notified of our action.
The early hours of the afternoon pass. No enemy
squadron appears to take up the challenge.
Will our armed forces below the horizon have to
wait in vain for the wireless announcing that our
enemy will avenge the insult offered their territory?
Is France really at war with Austria? The
commander of the squadrons comes to make his
report to the rear-admiral of the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
He tells of the terror of the inhabitants of
Lissa, their meekness, the taking of two hostages
on board his destroyer. Our wireless requests
supplementary orders from the Commander-in-Chief.
Suddenly, emerging from the maze of the
Austrian islands, appear at last two columns of
smoke. All the glasses and telescopes are turned
towards these longed-for shadows. Our hearts
leap; our eyes fear they are mistaken. But no!
The enemy is replying to the insult. Numerous
masts are graven on the horizon. Everyone sees
them rise, and whenever a new one appears utters
a cry of joy. Five! Ten! Fifteen! Eighteen!
The great Day has come.</p>

<p>The sun shines brightly. Not a ripple breaks
the sea. Our rear-admiral hoists signals of chase
and combat, the division of cruisers and two
squadrons of destroyers advance with all speed
toward the hostile smoke. As yet we do not know
the strength, the number, the armament, of this
enemy who offers battle. What matter! The
tops of its stacks cover the northwest sky. We
must hasten to the fray. If our first engagement
is not victorious, the wireless calls we send to the
battleships will bring them hurriedly to the victory
we have led up to with our first attack. Joyous
trumpets sound to clear the decks for action;
the ships of France hoist the shield of battle, the
national flag, perfectly new, at the junction of
two masts. In a few minutes all the men are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
running to their posts. They laugh, they sing,
they are crazy with excitement. But hardly have
they reached their apparatus than they have regained
the silence of duty. Firemen at the fires,
engineers at the engines, gunners at the guns,
have prompt arms, steady spirits, and alert eyes.
Along the hull the spray leaps and glides, like
the road beside an automobile. In the turret
the commandant, the firing officers, and the
maneuver officer, await anxiously the moment
when they will recognize the enemy as he presents
himself to us. They want to increase the speed
of the ship, but our screws are already turning
madly; they cannot add a millimeter to our speed.
At last, on the curve of the sea, are clearly drawn
the outlines of our enemy.</p>

<p>Alas! They are nothing but destroyers! Rapid
and powerful destroyers, indeed; but Austria
could have afforded to offer us antagonists equal
to ourselves. Let us be content with the windfall.
Too many days have been squandered against invisible
enemies. These are real, living, and full
of fight. They gallop towards us, with torpedoes
leveled. We point our guns, which cannot yet
reach them. The match is even. Like us, they
have hoisted the flag of battle; and the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>,
springing over the water like a full-blooded
steed, leads the cruisers and the two
squadrons to the adventure where death awaits.</p>

<p>A few minutes of anxious silence pass. Shut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
in the cells below, the men listen, trying to catch
the heavy sound of the first broadside; they would
be killed in an instant if a well-aimed torpedo
should touch the cruiser, but they devote their
stalwart souls to the machinery and the engines,
that no one may be wanting in this crisis.
Through their telescopes the gun-pointers watch
the distance vanishing as if by miracle. Twenty
thousand meters.... Eighteen thousand....
Fifteen thousand.... Fourteen thousand....
Only two thousand more, and the rattle of our
artillery will rain upon the enemy. In three
parallel lines the Austrian destroyers throw out
torrents of smoke, which seem to merge; each line
glides over the blue water like a shining serpent.
Around us our own destroyers have closed up, and
are plowing up clods of spray silvered by the
sunlight.</p>

<p>But what is this! The Austrian lines swerve,
deflect; their head makes a great curve! Is it
possible? They would retreat! They would refuse
an engagement! We are so angry that our
eyes refuse to believe the retreat. It is an illusion
of the light; a jest of the wind that makes the
smoke bend. Not at all. They complete the circle,
turn their backs on us, and fly off at top speed
like three trains along their rails of foam.</p>

<p>Oh! To have this revenge in sight for so many
futile weeks, and then to see it escape just at
the point where our guns cannot reach! To feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
that the great engines under our feet, strong as
they are, are unable to catch the prey, because
its legs are too long! To measure the distance,
and feel it increase a little with every second, like
an elastic band of air stretched between us! Fourteen
thousand meters!</p>

<p>Fourteen thousand one hundred.... Fourteen
thousand two hundred. Ah! we should like to
be able to control the waves, to throw into the
air a sudden squall, to chop up a sea of billows
and swells. Our own powerful keels would not
be slowed down, but the destroyers would run
foul of each crest of the waves, would slacken,
become exhausted, and our mettle would triumph
over their cowardice.</p>

<p>They make speed towards the labyrinth of the
Dalmatian Isles, which loom before us as a family
of marine monsters might emerge from the water.
We continue the pursuit. Sixteen thousand
meters.... Seventeen thousand meters....
Perhaps remorse or faintness will seize the
cowards. But no, their confusion is a premeditated
ruse. Up in the sky, gliding and descending
through the transparent clouds, an aviator drops
toward the French ships, enfilades them, and lets
fall on us bombs which only the cleverest tacking
evades; they burst against the hulls. One of the
cruisers catches the wake of a periscope on the
surface of the water. It may be that some prowling
submarine has already fired its torpedoes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
and our speed has deluded it; no one is affected.
We shell the path of this streak of foam, which
immediately vanishes. The submarine flees below
the water, the aeroplane is already out of sight,
the destroyers are nearing the entrance to the
islands. Eighteen thousand meters.... Nineteen
thousand.... Each second of pursuit increases
the danger, the useless danger which has no
chance of reward. It is becoming evident that
this Parthian flight leads us into the zone where
other submarines are prowling, and other aviators
lurking, where slumber dangerous mines, which
can inflict slaughter without stirring from their
position. Why excite ourselves? We are rushing
towards a death that will bring no glory to
the Navy, no benefit to France. Austria will have
a victory which will not even have <i>achetée son
courage</i>.</p>

<p>The rear-admiral has the signals hoisted. While
the Austrian destroyers are hidden in the straits
into which they hope to draw us, our cruisers and
destroyers make a wide detour in the offing; our
engines carry us disdainfully away from these
coasts which shelter no gallant enemy. One by
one, from the depths of the ship, the men who
have been enclosed during the combat come out
again. They have seen and heard nothing, and
they eagerly ask the news. The sailors on deck
talk to them in a low voice. Their cheeks turn
pale, they clench their hands, their eyes flash with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
rage. The dejected crew moves silently up and
down. Their faces are melancholy, their hearts
sore, their nerves seem to have lost their spring.</p>

<p>At twilight, a few hours later, we call together
the “naval army.” By means of the wireless
messages sent during our chase, the ships have
followed with passionate interest the enthusiasm,
effort, dangers, and disappointments we have
been through. Ready enough to help us, and to
give the Austrian fleet a good reception had it
come out, they are awaiting us for still another
descent of the Adriatic, also to be unfruitful, like
so many others. For half an hour, under the
golden beams of the setting sun, the squadrons
go through the usual maneuvers and get their sailing
orders for the night. The majestic, supple
lines cross one another, approach and recede upon
the parade ground of the sea. Every movement
is perfect; the scene resembles a procession of
moving cathedrals. In the evening light the hulls
take on all the colors of stained windows. The
water is strewn with azure and purple flowers.
The signals run up and down the masts. Into
the sky rise curls of smoke. A religious silence
prevails.</p>

<p>The night falls. Up among the islands, enveloped
in mist, the Austrians can observe our
contemptuous evolutions and our dignified departure.
Not one of our movements displays any
disquietude. Let this sorry enemy dare to rouse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
us, and they will find, at any hour of day and
night, something to talk about! But we are learning
to know them. Lazily the battleships and
destroyers spread over the broad surface of the
Adriatic and begin their majestic descent. This
morning the cruisers were to northwards, in the
vanguard. This evening they are deployed to the
south, where their vigilance will win them some
consolation for the afternoon.</p>

<p class="right"><i><span class="padright">Off Bari, 3 November;</span><br>
four o’clock in the morning.</i></p>

<p>Thank God, I was on watch during the dark
hours of the night. I should never have been able
to abandon myself to sleep. For the disappointment
of yesterday left me full of an exaltation
there was no real battle to exhaust, and a thousand
disconnected ideas raced through my brain.
Even yet, after four hours of watching disturbed
by alarms, I cannot find an instant of repose on
my bed. I rise and come to talk with the confidante
who is always ready, this notebook, which
has received the confession of all my moods. Perhaps
after this one-sided conversation my mind
will become calmer and forget itself in sleep. But
I am not sure. For we do not really know how
to put ourselves to sleep.</p>

<p>I envy the soldiers on the solid land, confronting
an enemy present before them. Whether he
hides or reveals himself, the conflict is not slow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
in coming. They rush forward, they sing and
shout; they thrust out their bayonets, they bite,
and trample with their feet. At the moment of
killing it is delicious to become a beast, to think
no longer, to dry with a single gesture the sweat
from one’s brow, and the blood from one’s
wounds. But the sailors spend their energies in
a long silent waiting. The more active they are,
the more profound is their silence. The nearness
of death makes them machines of precision.</p>

<p>I envy the soldiers who salute while charging
their fallen enemy. They have seen him coming.
Their short duel ends either in the intoxication
of victory or the repose of death. Our long journeys
are furtive steps in a temple of phantoms.
Those who want to slay us crawl in the heart of
liquid shadows. Those who defy us refuse an
encounter, and entice us into the snares of the
sea.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Night lags on the Adriatic. Nothing seems to
live except our dreams. With elbows on the rail,
eyes lost in the vastness, the officers of the cruisers
keep somber and silent. Near their guns, motionless
as statues sculptured out of shadow, the
gunners watch in vain, and reflect on the disappointments
of yesterday. In the distance there
is a splendid thunderstorm. Forks of light leap
from Italy to Austria; not a thunder peal echoes,
but the air is alternately vivid and dark. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
lightning comes and goes ceaselessly, like the
winking of an electric giant. Black and white,
white and black, the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> glides
through a gleaming sea. Are there enemies about
us? Is the sea safe? How can our eyes tell, as
they pass from an illumination whiter than the
sun into an opaqueness blacker than nothingness?
Every electric shock jangles the strings of our
taut nerves. A reflection on the water takes the
form of a destroyer; the straight path of the
lightning shoots like a rocket of the enemy; the
shadow has the thickness, the consistency, and
almost the odor of smoke from a hostile ship.</p>

<p>O demons of the atmosphere, how you play with
the sailors! Over there, towards the north, the
watchers on the battleships have felt their hearts
expand and contract with each of your shining
caprices. But even greater is the disquietude of
the cruisers who precede and protect the squadrons.
Yesterday Austria saw us. In a grand gesture
she refused us battle. To-night we feel it
coming, we are sure of it. She has despatched her
atrocious submarines. They blockade the Adriatic
and watch for us. When shall we fall into their
claws? In a minute, an hour, a day? We are
illuminated like specters by every flash, but they
are buried in the black waves. Both the cruisers
and the battleships who trust themselves to our
vigilance are lost in an ocean of illusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>Early in the morning an ensign translates a
wireless from Malta. By way of numberless
cables this message brings news from the Pacific.
Under the massive shadows of the Cordilleras
of the Andes, three English cruisers were swallowed
up in the Chilean twilight. They fought
against stronger vessels, but the German guns
<i>a eu raison de leur valeur</i>. Twelve years ago,
from the height of the American peaks, I had
looked over the infinite expanse where this passage
at arms took place. A few years ago, during a
cruise to China, I had visited these same British
vessels. I remember their appearance; faces that
smiled at me then are now, no doubt, sleeping
over there on the threshold of the <i>madrepores</i>;
fingers which pressed mine are twisting the dark
sea-weed, the sailor’s shroud. I envy those ships.
I envy the dead of the battle of Coronel. A few
weeks later, we shall know the details of their
glorious end, but from now on I shall envy them,
for they have fulfilled their destiny. It was not
vainly that their torn flag shone in the sun. They
struck, they perished, their eyes have carried with
them into the deep the vision of battle; their death
transmits a heritage of vengeance to which all
British sailors are the heirs.</p>

<p>Why does fate give us in the Adriatic a felon
enemy that only runs away? Certainly I hate
the Germans; but at least you find them when
you look for them. Whereas to draw from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
depths of the sea the only adversaries that Austria
sends against us we should need picks and
rakes. Our magazines are full, our engines are
quivering, our guns thrust out their jaws, but all
that crawls in the Adriatic desert is the submarine.</p>

<p>Silent lightning flashes, alternate shafts and
shadows burn our eyelids. The four hours of the
watch pass. My eyes are fixed on the blackness;
my dreams encircle the earth every moment. A
procession of memories has accompanied the
storm. Perfumes from Indo-China, the theaters
of Paris, negresses of Guadeloupe, Madagascar
cyclones, idylls of the West and tragedies of the
East, tropic homesickness, and the English countryside—the
whole procession of the past glides
through my watch. Smiling, mystical, dim, it
hastens to respond to my mood of nervous fatigue.
It leaps upon the bridge to companion my solitude.
About all my comrades, about the officers,
who like me have become hermits of the deep,
there crowds in the same way the phantoms of
the past. We do not summon them. They run
to us, form in line, yield place to others; the train
of our dreams is more mobile than the sea. Meanwhile
duty does not suffer. The round of
memories never deflects our eyes or our ears from
the surface of the waters. When necessary, we
can scatter the memories with a single gesture,
and do whatever is needful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>In the freshness of the early dawn the breath
of the breeze calms all this fever. My mind
pauses on the last rung of the ladder of memory.
There it rests, and at the end of my watch I
find myself back again in a garden of Malta. According
to the calendar this episode dates only
eight days back, but it seems to me that our life
has thrown it into the remote past.</p>

<p>In the midst of the arid rocks of Malta there is
a garden, enclosed with high walls. The parterres
of black soil, imported from Sicily, are cut by
alleys of gravel. On the terrace bloom the rarest
flowers under the sun. They are not European,
they are choice specimens from America and Asia.
The corollas which grow in this garden come only
from certain Southern archipelagoes, but human
skill has made them live in Malta.</p>

<p>Arbors shelter benches of ancient stone. Here
and there arches of perfume brush the dreamer’s
head. Since it is a place of quiet and sovereign
beauty, human beings do not frequent it. Every
evening, before returning to the noisy streets of
Malta, I spend a few solitary hours in the company
of the flowers. Only the gardeners disturb
my revery, but they early become acquainted with
me. The third evening one offered me the bouquet
that still perfumes my cabin, and refused my
grateful reward.</p>

<p>That evening I was walking at the end of the
garden, by a fountain with a brim of stone and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
two basins of green water. In it the twilight
reflections dissolve. The fragrance that lingers
there is enchanting. On this little lake float two
white swans. They know that their prison will
never be larger; the paddles of their feet are still;
their dazzling wings, rose-tinted in the setting sun,
open like a sail to the breaths of the breeze, and
they glide very gently, bending their necks as if
to breathe in the exquisite sweetness of the
evening.</p>

<p>A little dog, tawny and silken, ran around the
fountain, barking at the swans when they skirted
the rim, at their disdain when they moved towards
the center of the pool. On a bench a woman
dressed in mauve was reading a book, turning the
page slowly. The air held only the last vestiges
of light. When this woman raised her attentive
eyes towards the dog, she revealed a sorrowful
face and eyes heavy with passion.</p>

<p>I am slightly disturbed by these neighbors, but
I sit down and abandon myself to the witchery of
the colors and odors of the dying day. Sorrow
is solaced by an excess of sorrow, and the exile
finds joy only in an excess of exile. Solitary, between
the past and the future, I am at peace.</p>

<p>There in the fragrance of the garden, the sea,
the war, the how and why of things, all disappear.
My thoughts float, without support, like the exhalations
of flowers which hasten to give out a
sweet odor before falling asleep. But the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
tawny dog, excited by the play of the swans, leaps
towards the nearest ones, and falls into the water.
He keeps himself up, paddling round in the same
place; he scratches at the slippery rim of the
fountain. Unable to climb out, he whines piteously.
I fish him out by his silky ears. He shakes
himself, shakes water on my shoes, and the lady
in mauve rises to thank me.</p>

<p>Who ever remembers words spoken at twilight?
She spoke the soft Italian tongue, and I replied in
kind. Why, as I came from the shores of Malta,
should I forget French in favor of the tongue of
Dante and d’Annunzio? The little tawny dog
followed us. I learned that he is called Jimmino.</p>

<p>Deep eyes, a face which was not pretty but
which I thought to be more beautiful than beauty,
was sometimes raised to mine. We walked along
together, both weary. Our words were vague, and
yet each one found its mark. I understood my
own fatigue; but what was this woman’s with the
tragic face? We had not told each other our
secrets, and yet it seemed that for each other we
had no more secrets. She was beautifully dressed,
in rare and simple material. Her jewels were real.
Night had enveloped us when we reached the gates
of the town. You wish to know what we said to
each other on the way? I do not remember. Under
an electric light in the street, we pressed each
other’s hands; her eyes dominated her pale face,
and I thought her fingers trembled. Who is this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
passer-by whom perhaps I shall never see again,
and will she take her place in the company of the
shadows who people the life of the sailor? I do
not even know her name.</p>

<p>On the bridge my successor in the watch comes
to replace me.</p>

<p>“Speed, twelve knots,” I say to him. “Route,
to the south. We have passed the light at Bari.
Range of the guns, fifteen hundred meters. Deflection,
forty-four and fifty-six. Light wind from
southwest. Storm continues on the whole horizon.
Nothing in sight. A good watch to you!”</p>

<p>And I go down to my cabin. Perhaps after
two hours of confession on paper, I shall find
oblivion for this chaos in which my dreams are
tossed. But I must sleep, for in six hours I stand
watch again, and the folly of the mind must not
be allowed to weaken the body.</p>

<p class="right"><i><span class="padright2">3 November,</span><br>
four o’clock in the afternoon.</i></p>

<p>Well, no! Sleep did not come this morning,
and all these dreams came near ending in a fatal
nightmare.</p>

<p>After a few hours of unquiet rest, I had to rise,
make a hasty toilet, and swallow what food I
could before resuming the lookout. In the middle
of the day I found myself on the bridge I had
left in darkness a few hours before. The sea was
silvery in a bright sun. In a spreading line the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
three cruisers continued their course towards the
southern end of the Adriatic. Behind us, almost
invisible on the horizon, the smoke of the “naval
army” made a black smudge. On board, everyone
not on watch was taking a siesta, getting consolation
in sleep for the disappointments of the
preceding day. But dozens of eyes were watching
this calmest of seas. Light mists, idle as the
feathers of birds, moved here and there on the
blue sea. A few thousand meters away the <i>Ernest
Renan</i> followed a parallel course.</p>

<p>Suddenly in the streaks of foam appeared something
whiter. My glass at once followed this
wrinkle on the water; one would have said it was
a jet of steam, glistening in the sunlight. I hesitated
a few moments. Perhaps I had been
deceived by the fin of a porpoise swimming at
the surface. But the memory of drills during
peace-times set before my eyes the wake of a
periscope, and I hesitated no longer.</p>

<p>“On watch! To port! Range, eight hundred
meters! Deflection, forty! The three engines ahead
full ahead! Close the port stanchions! Open
fire!”</p>

<p>The cruiser leaps. Below, the men on watch
close the port stanchions. The volley of guns
goes off, and the shells fall round that white moving
spot. They burst like balls of snow on a
blue wall. All the men wake from their siesta,
the officers come on deck. At several meters from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
our hull passes the flaky line of a launched torpedo.
It has missed us, but a big 194 shell, fired
from one of our turrets, bursts just above the
periscope, which rises, sinks, rises and sinks again,
like a wounded animal which lifts itself and falls
back. And then we see nothing more. The blue
water shows only its usual indolence. From the
<i>Ernest Renan</i> comes to us a burst of hurrahs
across the air; they have seen the shell tear up
the water, and have decided that the explosion
destroyed the submarine.</p>

<p>We move rapidly, so rapidly that in a very few
moments the cruiser is far away from the deadly
spot. The guns turn and follow, ready to fire
again, but nothing more appears.</p>

<p>“Cease fire! Watch ended! Open the port
stanchions! Return to course! The three engines
at sixty revolutions!”</p>

<p>In a few seconds the cruiser resumes its watch.
It has just proved that it cannot be caught napping,
and everything falls back into what appears
to be somnolence, but a somnolence with eyes wide
open. Have I sunk an Austrian submarine? I
shall never know. This deceitful enemy that hides
itself to strike, and hides itself to die! One at
least will not attack the precious battleships which
follow us.</p>

<p>Towards the east a few minutes later the <i>Jules
Ferry</i>, a cruiser with four stacks, which has been
reconnoitering on the other side of the horizon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
signals that a torpedo from an invisible submarine
has passed a few meters from its hull. So there
were at least two of these invisible enemies, and
it was the cruisers that baffled their attempt. The
Commander-in-Chief can descend fearlessly the
path which we have just swept clear.</p>

<p>What does one feel on learning in the space
of less than a minute that a cruiser worth fifty
millions and carrying a thousand men has been
dependent for life on the promptness of an order
or the intelligence of a maneuver? I know nothing
about it, and all those who have known great
responsibility in this war will understand what
I mean. A little later on, it seems to me, one
feels afraid of the peril that is now past. It
presents itself under terrifying colors which in
the moment of action one did not see at all.
Courage is easy enough; you need only get out
of yourself, think of others, and everything becomes
simple. Afterwards you are much fatigued.
After yesterday’s disillusionment, I doubted my
being able to sleep. To-day, after this danger,
I am sure to escape insomnia. The phantoms of
the past will not knock at the door of my memory,
for I have lived through a great moment of my
life. I may have saved the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>!</p>

<p class="right"><i>Otranto Canal, 11 November.</i></p>

<p>Outside or near the shore, in a peaceful harbor
or in a roadstead whipped by the winds, a naval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
collier speaks the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>. For several
hours coal by the hundreds of tons passes from
the collier to the ship. After so many days of
watching and weariness, and of stoking the fires,
this is the rest which our crews taste. We coal
in front of Corfu or Paxo, or in some cove of
Epirus. Each week our insatiable furnaces demand
a thousand tons of coal; each week we burn
them up in our futile promenades across the
Adriatic sea.</p>

<p>From dawn to dusk our sailors fill sacks in
the bottom of the collier’s hold; their shovels
and picks labor in the bosom of the black stuff;
windlasses raise the clumps of sacks, and cast
them on the deck. There other gangs take charge,
lower the sacks by chutes into the bowels of the
<i>Waldeck</i>, dragging them by hand through the
labyrinth of passageways, and into the gaping
jaws of the stores; at the edge of the store-room
two men with powerful muscles turn out with one
stroke a hundred kilos of coal which fall down
into the darkness amid a cloud of blinding dust.
Crouched at the bottom of the store-room, other
sailors receive this dark avalanche, pouring
minute after minute; they direct it, pile it up in
empty corners, and, stumbling on the piles, their
eyes burned by the tar, their mouths poisoned
with soot, prepare the way for the new torrents
which are coming.</p>

<p>You would imagine yourself in a cavern of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
infernal regions. Around the cruiser and the
collier a thick halo sullies the atmosphere. Bound
together by heavy hawsers, the two boats roll on
the waves or in the wind like two black swans.
On the decks and broadsides you see only dark
forms which move with sluggish gestures; bare
feet travel furtively the carpet of coal spread over
the steel; electric lights under a black film throw
a strange and somewhat sinister light; human beings
pass, loaded with heavy sacks, knees bowed,
eyes and teeth white in a perspiring negro mask;
they pant and blow and suffer. Their muscles
are aching with this work fit only for horses, and
beg for mercy. Yet they sing. At the moment
when the cloud is heaviest, the odor most acrid,
and the light most livid, a hoarse young voice rises
out of the gloom. It attempts the first verses of
some gay song: “The Young Girls of Rochelle!”
“Queen Pomare!” “The Gray Lark!” Right
and left, high and low, invisible singers respond.
The coalholes become alive; behind the partitions
of steel a smothered baritone joins its raucous
tones to those of a tenor armed with a pick. And
in the immense maze of the holds, the broadsides
and corridors, flows a harmony, at once sad and
joyous, a memory of France in days of peace.
There is no conductor and no metronome, but the
singing is in good time and tune. The cruiser
vibrates in unison with it.</p>

<p>When the song is ended, one hears for several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
minutes only indistinct breathings and stampings.
Sack by sack the tons of coal stock the holds, and
the monotonous rain accompanies the interminable
labor.</p>

<p>For Nature begins to grow somber. The worst
weather has not come yet, but the sky suggests
the melancholy of winter; the South Wind sometimes
gives place to the North Wind, and we have
bitter hours. Then the coalings are unspeakably
dismal; our beautiful cruiser is clothed in a dusty
cloak which trails over her hull like a mourning
mantle; the smoke from the stacks mingles with
the gusts of coaldust which the wind and rain
plaster over the guns, the cordage, and one’s own
skin. Floods of despair seem to descend from
the clouds.</p>

<p>To chase away these evil impressions we go
to talk with the Captain and the officers of the
collier. They come from Cardiff or from Newcastle,
are familiar with the ports of England
and France, have seen our French comrades and
the British fleets; they bring us news of the vast
world. We listen to them eagerly. They too
belong to the great fraternity of navigators, and
the tales they tell us are like the Odyssey we
live. Up there, far up, between Norway and
Scotland, the English cruisers are keeping indefatigable
watch, and they are less fortunate than
we. For there the sea is sinister. Around England,
without pause or respite, in terrible storms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
the Allied destroyers prowl everywhere. Covered
with spray, laboring through the fog, they contend
with the sea without meeting any other
enemy; and the fleet of Admiral Jellicoe dances
attendance like our own “naval army!” Ignominious
and cowardly, the German enemy hides
himself, just as here the Austrian burrows away.
The proud descendants of Nelson await a new
Trafalgar, and to them the prudence of the Germans
opposes only hidden enemies, the submarines.
As for our French brothers, the destroyers
and Atlantic cruisers, they journey from
Calais to Brest without adventure; convoyers of
transports, policemen of the waves—customs-officers
of contraband, they do not experience the
excitements of the Adriatic hunts. Their task,
more obscure than ours, is also more ungrateful.
And since the happiness of man is measured by
the unhappiness of others, we are happy in the
Adriatic in spite of our disillusion and our exile.</p>

<p>But the day passes. The Captain of the collier
offers us the latest papers, we give him the last
wireless messages, and we must separate.
Whether or not the coaling is ended, the cruiser
never stands still during the night. We cast off
the hawser, the screws turn; the crew, black with
coaldust, go to rest their weary limbs after the
crushing toil of the boilers, the engines, and the
watch. And during the rest of the night the
cruiser makes a hundred or a hundred and fifty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
miles. It matters not whether the sea is calm or
disturbed, the sky clear or rainy. Men and officers
observe the same vigilance as they did yesterday
and will to-morrow; every boat that is sighted is
chased, stopped, visited; one takes no account of
weariness or sleep. One goes steadily on, always
steadily on.</p>

<p>And if the thousand or twelve hundred tons
necessary are not taken on in a single day, we
return next day to the collier. The rendezvous
is not at the same place, but in quite a distant
roadstead or bay, for fear that the enemy, forewarned,
will send us a submarine while we are
practically helpless. In all haste we finish emptying
the coal; the holds are full to the jaws, the
sailors take courage and forget their weariness
in a supreme effort. We fortify ourselves again
for eight or ten days, for the excitements of the
Adriatic, the dangers of the sea and the torpedoes.</p>

<p>Everything is impregnated with coal. There
is no barrier or filter against this microbe. Bathing
in floods of water, brushing and scraping does
not chase it from its lairs. In our food our teeth
encounter crunching lumps; our hair is tarnished
with a black cosmetic; and the folds of our whitest
linen conceal little hoards of soot. Our whitest
linen! Is there a world where they know the
pleasure of immaculate shirts? Of handkerchiefs
pure as snow? When we set out, each one of us
took along only what was strictly necessary. Our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
boxes are few, and in a day we soil more than
in a week of peace. Where are the washes of other
days? where the polite laundresses of the ports,
who washed the linen and cambric in twenty-four
hours? Our cruises last eight or nine weeks.</p>

<p>How many times already I have washed in my
basin two handkerchiefs and a shirt so covered
with coaldust that the white places spotted it!
Like all my comrades I have a sailor at my service.
But he is a good gunner, who only looks after
me when his duties do not call him elsewhere.
Every day he has ten hours of lookout and three
or four of preparation of materials. Must he
not sleep and eat? When he is free, I try to take
a few hours of broken rest on my bunk, and he
respects my sleep. When my cabin is empty, he
is watching behind his gun. Each one of us
washes what he can. The soft water we use does
not come from clear fountains, but from the boiler
tubes which distil the sea-water; it stands in great
metal casks, it is filled with rust and retains the
color of it. In vain we throw in soap and borax;
the washed linen turns yellow as if powdered with
mustard, and it is never quite dry. The falling
rains, the smoke which sweeps the deck, do not
permit hanging it outdoors. In my cabin my
gunner has stretched two strings between the port
hole and the moulding above my bunk, and up
there the linen dries as well as it can. Sometimes,
while I sleep or work, an idle drop falls on my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
face or my paper; other times the constant vibration
of the cruiser throws the linen to the coal-stained
linoleum, and the whole thing has to be
done over again. In the “naval army,” as in
the trenches, nothing is clean but the wind.</p>

<p>As in the trenches, too, we try to kill time,
which lags so terribly. The study of the military
map is misleading; we are accustomed, as each
communiqué is received by wireless, to stick flags
on the Western and Eastern fronts. The pins
change every day by a quarter or a tenth of a
millimeter; they have made so many holes in the
paper that one can no longer read the names, and
we have given up taking them out. Bundles of
papers arrive in each mail, are quickly read and
thrown aside; they feed neither our conversation
nor our reveries. We brought no books from
France because we thought them superfluous in a
short war, and those we have ordered for these
interminable cruises have not yet come. Letters
are quickly written when one has nothing much
to say and the censor forbids details.</p>

<p>What have we to do except play? Some spend
their hours off in Patience; it is all one to them
whether the combinations come out or not. Others
bend over the chess-board, or become absorbed in
bridge. But these are unusual kinds of chess and
bridge; no one ever has time to finish a game.
The service, the watch, meals, the time for sleeping,
interrupt you; you leave the chess game or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
the rubber where it is, and another officer takes
your place. A game commenced with certain
partners ends with a completely new set. Winning
or losing does not matter; one has time only to
kill, and must think of nothing else.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Adriatic Sea, 16 November.</i></p>

<p>For several weeks now the monotony of our
vagabondage has been broken by a pleasing distraction—divine
service celebrated every Sunday.
For the duration of the war the Government has
appointed on every admiral’s ship and every
hospital ship a volunteer chaplain. Ours arrived
the middle of October. His name is Mgr. Bolo.</p>

<p>Without regret he has left his care of feminine
souls, his delightful home in Touraine, and has
sought the hard life of the sailors. After a long
voyage he appeared at some bay in the Ionian
Isles where we were coaling, and climbed the iron
ladder of our ship in the thick of the rain and
soot. For several days, while he was bewildered
by the mazes of the cruiser, or breathless in his
stifling cabin, he might have wondered into what
world he had got. But a serene soul dwelt in his
athletic body; he quickly got over his confusion,
and in order to preach better to the sailors, he
wanted to learn their trade.</p>

<p>He is constantly asking questions; our jargon,
the complicated machinery, its mechanism and
control, do not repel him. His talk is enlivened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
with racy words; in him the sailors recognize a
brother. He is one of the crowd. Although his
hands are accustomed to priestly gestures, he
takes part in the embarkations. Each time we
put the gig or long-boat in the water, he takes
his place beside the coxswain and tries to direct
the crew. He soon learned the usual orders, how
to manage the sail and the oar, and how to make
a difficult landing or tack. In a few weeks he
could safely be entrusted with the direction of a
ship’s boat in all the difficulties of current, wind
and waves; he directed it with confident voice and
hand. Then we made him undergo the same examination
as the able seamen, and if it would
please him to have the title <i>in partibus</i>, we will
deliver to him the certificate which will make him
a real priest-sailor.</p>

<p>During the cruises he tries to pierce to the soul
of that mysterious race, the sailors. For those
who have preached to country and city folk the
task is not easy. The sailors, artless and at the
same time instructed by their travels, used to
danger and to duty, do not take to specious rhetoric
or childish advice. Hyperbole and platitude
displease them equally. They have minds like the
fishermen and workingmen whom of old John the
Baptist or Jesus persuaded. One must search
their heart rather than their reason, their imagination
rather than their intelligence. In this
way the preaching may bring them some simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
truths, admonish their rather loose impulses, and
give them resignation for their fatiguing tasks.</p>

<p>Every Sunday religious service is held on
board; it is a simple and dignified ceremony.
Around the portable altar, the flags make stained
windows; the arch of the church is replaced by
the low whitewashed ceiling between decks; to
right and left the partitions of the cabins, the
white bodies of the stacks form the metallic walls
of our temple; variegated funnels, valves, well-polished
faucets, throw out sparkling reds and
yellows; chairs for the officers, benches for the
crew, cover eight or ten meters of the space. Anyone
who wishes attends. A bugle call announces
the Mass, and anyone not on duty may be present
or may excuse himself. While the priest recites,
one hears the respiration of the engines below,
the snorting of the ventilators; overhead on deck
tramp the sailors of the watch; the great waves
of the Adriatic slap against the hull, and the
quiver of the moving ship makes the altar tremble.
Now and then there is music, old liturgic airs and
modern themes.</p>

<p>The priest addresses the sailors. He does not
need to teach them heroism, to make fine phrases.
The instinct of the sailors is surer. They are convinced
by eternal truths, discussed with sincerity.
Our Bretons, our Provençals, listen receptively to
the gospel of the day. When they hear simple
words, like those the Galilean used two thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
years ago, their lips are parted, their deep eyes
become absorbed, their souls grow better. But
if they hear argument, they make an effort to
understand, they knit their brows, they discuss
within their own minds. They reflect what is good
and clear and simple; one is sure to touch them
when one seeks their hearts.</p>

<p>The <i>Domino, salvam fac rempublicam</i> is played.
The priest passes between the rows on his way
to his cabin, and the congregation disperses. Five
minutes later, benches and flags have disappeared,
the place has recovered its solitude and its calm.
The sailors before the engines or behind the guns
remember with pleasure what they have just
heard. Believers or not, they know that sincere
words have been spoken and yield themselves to
their influence.</p>

<p>Thus, in early ages, in the clearings or the
fields, the apostles must have preached to rude
peoples. They sowed the seed that ripened
throughout the centuries; their temples were no
more splendid than this steel vessel which spends
every Sunday traversing the sea.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Near Santa Maria de Leuca,<br>
<span class="padright2">17 November.</span></i></p>

<p>We have on board an eye which never sleeps;
it is the wireless. Its apparatus is buried in the
depths of the ship; a cabin hung with mattresses
isolates the operators from the noise of the engines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
and the general confusion. The telegraphers
listen to messages from every direction;
the lowest murmurs of the electric voice do not
escape their ears.</p>

<p>The air vibrates continually. From stations far
and near, from ships sailing the Atlantic or nearer
waters, the calls and messages find their way;
the air carries them instantaneously. The powerful
poles of the Eiffel Tower, Ireland, Germany,
Italy, Constantinople, overcome the fainter messages.
They send out to any distance, with all
their force, the official news of the conflict. If
someone else is speaking too loud five hundred
or a thousand kilometers away, they increase their
current, swell their voices, until these interlopers
are silent.</p>

<p>There is a certain tacit agreement about their
transmission. Germany does not interrupt
France; the Turk waits until Malta has finished;
Madrid, talking with Berlin, ceases when London
speaks. For these great stations, controlled by
the Governments, send out only the more important
messages, those which the entire world
ought to hear; they wish neither to be confused
nor to confuse others. Communiqués from the
front, events at sea, diplomatic or financial transactions,
apologias or recriminations, circulate in
all languages. One can be sure the papers will
not publish them. If by chance the reader finds
them in his daily newspaper, it will be a week or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
two later, under some disconnected, unrecognizable
form.</p>

<p>The sailors, however, get all the news. While
the censor limits the rest of the world to
meager and belated information, we know it
all already. We can rejoice or mourn in advance
of the rejoicings and grief of millions.
Ireland announces a simple strategic movement
of the Russians, but Norddeich—the German station—echoes
everywhere the claim of a German
victory, with an advance and the taking of thousands
of prisoners. Norddeich relates briefly
some happening at sea, but Eiffel makes her most
powerful sparks crackle as she sends to Moscow,
to Terra Nueva, to the Soudan and the Red Sea,
the news of a naval disaster to some German
ships. How soon and in what distorted form will
the public read this news? At every hour of day
and night we receive the messages, brutal and
imperious.</p>

<p>We cannot be deceived. Even our enemies take
no pains to prevaricate in these messages to ambassadors,
consuls, and their innumerable agents
who uphold German prestige throughout the
world. It is of the utmost importance for Germany
that these men receive honest information
with which to make a case for their negotiations.
There is nothing in common between the rhapsodies
of the papers or the Wolff Agency, and its
wireless information. At the most, in the case of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
defeats, it carefully renders a vague account. But
this vagueness makes us prick up our ears, and
in a few hours London or Paris confirms the English
or French victory.</p>

<p>Outside of chancelleries and Government offices
there are no maps kept up to date except those
on ships of war. In the ward-room we argue over
the flags that are placed at the precise spot where
they should be; our predictions and our hopes are
rarely deceived. And if secrecy did not bind us
to silence, we could tell our friends much news.</p>

<p>But underneath these important voices of the
wireless are whispers of many lesser tones, just
as in the tropical forest the roaring of the lions
does not silence the sounds of insects and rodents;
this undertone of smaller voices is what gives
the jungle its deep voice. The thin voices of the
ships that speak to us give the sea air a mysterious
animation. A great liner on its way from
tropic seas announces its passage by some
frequented cape. A torpedo-boat on patrol near
Gibraltar tells Port Said of the ships it has
sighted. This torpedo-boat’s apparatus is not
powerful enough to call the other end of the
Mediterranean; it signals Bizerta or Toulon,
which answer it, take its message, and send it like
a ball rebounding on the stations at Malta, on
the masts of a French cruiser in the Ionian, on
the wires of a Russian ship in the Ægean Sea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
until it finally reaches the station at Port Said.
A mail-boat gives information about its position;
a squadron asks for orders; a naval attaché or
ambassador sends word about espionage; the
Resident General at Morocco is sending grain to
Montenegro; the patrols warn of a submarine in
sight; colliers ask us to tell them where they will
find certain battleships: the whole Mediterranean
knocks at the wireless station of the Commander-in-Chief,
like a crowd of subalterns at the door
of the officer who is giving out orders.</p>

<p>And the Commander-in-Chief on his splendid
battleship—a moving office—decides, orders, directs;
the sonorous rays shoot out from the mast
where floats his flag that represents France, and
through space, far and near, through the stations
which relay them farther on, travels their echo to
the ear of the recipients.</p>

<p>There is no disorder, no discord, in these messages.
Just as with the players in a well directed
orchestra, all the speakers speak on the minute,
at the very instant they should; watch in hand,
the telegraphers wait for their moment, and at
the highest speed send their dashes, short and
long; at the end of their period whether they have
finished or not, they stop and wait, for immediately
a distant voice begins to play its tune,
and would complain violently if someone prevented
its talking. The Mediterranean is divided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
into sectors, and the time distributed between
them, so that no one is allowed to speak if the
schedule requires him to be silent.</p>

<p>Offenders, moreover, are soon recognized. Just
as the finger of a blind man acquires surprising
sensibility, the telegraphers come to know the
timber, sharpness of tone and musical richness
of these babblers they have never seen. For the
initiated the electric radiations have a personality
like human talk. Two stations, two ships,
have distinct voices and deliveries. This one
sputters, that one speaks slowly and gravely; the
sound of one resembles a match struck on sand
paper, another buzzes like a fly, another sings
sharply like a mosquito. It is a magic concert.
In his padded cabin the receiver hears and makes
out the whisperings of the grasshopper, the scrapings
of violins, the rattle of beetles, the frying
of boiling oil, all the sounds which the fantastic
electricity reproduces hundreds of miles away.
It jumps, stops, recommences; one would call it
a symphony of goblins in a boundless land. And
yet the least of these vibrations is a messenger
of war, of life, or of death.</p>

<p>They are careful to use secret languages. There
is not a word or phrase in this continual interchange
which anyone could interpret without the
keys upon which depends the safety of the ships.
Nothing but cipher circulates through the air. All
the combinations which the human mind could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
invent, all the ingenuities devised by specialists,
have been prepared beforehand. We improve on
the arrangements of ciphers; for fear that the
enemy, after receiving pages and pages of
ciphered texts, will succeed in forcing the lock,
the “naval army” does not long maintain the
same keys. It modifies them, turns them about,
rubs them down; and the officers in charge of the
translation are like travelers who change
languages at every frontier.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Furthermore, everyone does not speak the same
language; sometimes they address one another
without anyone’s being able to understand. From
Englishman to Englishman, Frenchman to
Frenchman, minister to admiral, admiral to
cruiser, commander-in-chief to the least of his
satellites, ambassador to battleship, consulate to
shore station—between these leap dialogues in
unknown patois. The curious can listen, but they
will learn nothing. As worthy descendants of the
Gauls, whom Caesar describes as stopping
travelers en route to get news from them, we are
all eager to know the message of the ciphers which
we read without our codes’ being able to interpret
them. Labor lost! Perhaps one of us has
patience, enough, or works long enough, to decipher
a secret not meant for him. He is happy.
He acts important. He thinks he is very superior
to have known how to listen at the keyholes. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
some fine day the key whose secret he has learned
becomes useless in his hand; it gives him only
words without order, nonsense. The two talkers
have amused themselves with changing the lock,
and everything has to be done again. The naval
allies dread enemies with ears that are too wide
open as much as indiscreet friends with too long
tongues. And it is a good thing they do.</p>

<p>Besides, we have enough to do in translating
the intelligible messages. In addition to the
lieutenant of the chief vessel of the patrol and
the chief of the watch and his second, there is a
fourth officer who spends his whole time looking
over files of texts received by the wireless. At
his side are codes and dictionaries containing
every word, phrase or signal which he needs to
know. He spends four hours translating the numbers
into French. English, Russians, French,
Montenegrins, Serbs, all have something important,
something vital, to say. During the day
a hundred or even two hundred telegrams arrive,
and are transcribed in blankbooks; the sender,
the destination, the number, the hour of transmission,
are all carefully noted. These are the
archives of our naval Odyssey.</p>

<p>A wireless is often addressed to the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>.
The station that is calling sends out
into space the name of our cruiser. We respond.
From shore and from the ships come unexpected
instructions and questions. In the dark night we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
transmit to the Commander-in-Chief whatever
message demands a reply. The Commander considers,
weighs carefully the words which he will
send back; the officer in charge of the translating
writes it out clearly and concisely in cipher. And
a few minutes later the masts of the ship flash
out their long and short dashes into the midst
of the darkness. It is the answer that we are
sending. The wires stretched between the masts
become phosphorescent, the sparks crackle drily,
and instantaneously, at no matter what distance,
the one who is calling us hears the faint echo of
our voice.</p>

<p>Thus pass the days, vibrant with this invisible
business. Everyone tells what he knows, listens
to what he ought to hear, responds when he is
called. From the ocean to the Red Sea, all the
wandering ships are held together by these bands,
and the magical electric current effaces distance.
But there are times when one is silent.</p>

<p>When, on the trail of adventure, the bold vessels
go up the Adriatic to the threshold of their enemy,
their voices are as hidden as their path is dark.
However imperious the calls, they do not reply.
All about them, at Cattaro, at Lissa, in the islands
and arsenals, the telegraphic spies would hear
their voices as they approached. Dark and silent,
they move without speaking. All chinks are
stopped up in the cabin where the men listen.
All along the route, in these furtive hours, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
catch mysterious conversations. Some Austrian
spy in Italy or the Greek Islands has seen in the
twilight the departure of the French fleet towards
the north. In a chimney, or cellar or well, this
spy has concealed a transmitting station of which
the neutrals are ignorant; he sends brief messages
which sound like a whistle. We do not understand
the numbers, but we guess what they mean.
“The French are about to leave,” “they are leaving,”
“they are in the Adriatic,” “they are approaching
Cattaro.” No French mouth is responsible
for this hostile voice; we know it by its
singing timber like a flute or a mosquito’s buzz.
It is the Telefunken apparatus which produces
this sound, which one would recognize among a
thousand. All night its vibration follows us.
Whence come these whispers in the darkness? By
what miracle, from moment to moment, do we
hear these sonorous flashes which talk about nothing
but us? “The French are passing Brindisi;”
“they are passing Bari;” “they are turning towards
the northeast;” “about two o’clock they
will be near Pelagosa.” In the distance vibrate
the responses, which become more and more distinct.
It is Cattaro, Pola, the Dalmatian Isles,
awaiting us.</p>

<p>Yes, we move in a circle of sinister spirits, and
these Germans have prodigious ears. Their high
shrill murmur, undecipherable yet very clear,
darts round us as we advance through the darkness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
Perhaps destroyers and submarines are
lurking on our course. Those that have missed us
in our too rapid progress telegraph the next sentinel,
and he rushes toward us with his torpedo
ready. Where is he? Behind or in front?
Gunners, do not sleep at your guns! Officers, bend
over the empty blackness! Cruiser, enveloped in
shadow, move faster and ever faster! These evil
specters of the Adriatic are lying in wait for you;
the whistling of their ghostly lips prepares your
destruction! But do not be afraid. They will
wear themselves out in the pursuit, and to-morrow
you will be at the post where France desires you.</p>

<p>But what cruiser, which battleship, is destined
to receive the fatal wound from these singing
demons?</p>

<p class="right"><i>West of Corfu, 26 November.</i></p>

<p>The naval struggle in which the Germans pretended
to imitate the great corsairs of France has
ended with the destruction of the <i>Emden</i> by an
Australian cruiser in the Bay of Bengal. The
armed liners—the <i>Kaiser Wilhelm</i>, <i>Cecilie</i>, <i>Cape
Trafalgar</i>, and many others—have already paid
the penalty for their futile audacity. They
thought they could terrorize sailors and starve
out nations; but in fact the resources of life are
going to flow more abundantly than ever into the
markets of the Allies.</p>

<p>The navy is the guardian of the granaries. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
already knew it who frequented the important
routes in times of peace, but five months of labor
have proved to us that we never realized its full
significance.</p>

<p>We have seen pass us, and have protected, innumerable
freighters loaded with grain for bread,
with animals for meat, and steel for the manufacture
of shells. The warships have freed the
routes which supply our champions with food,
and have closed up the routes of the enemy. How
many months longer will this enterprise take?
The lips of the future are sealed. But the cruisers
and torpedo-boats, from Norway to the Ægean
Sea, do not shrink from their task. A nation at
war requires some of its defenders to labor in
assuring a living to those who fight. The deeds
of sailors are not brilliant and showy; and men
are not grateful to them for their fatigue. What
matter? If this obscure work of the ships keeps
the tears of famine from being added to the grief
of mourning, it will not have been without a glory
of its own; the smiles of happy little children will
be our reward.</p>

<p>But I am forgetting the <i>Emden</i> and the corsair
liners. Like the sea my imagination is somewhat
capricious. These restless corsairs are of a piece
with the general parody which German Kultur
offers us. What would the Jean Barts and the
Duquesnes say to the bandits that are spewed
forth from Kiel and Hamburg? In the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
period of Dunkirk and Saint Malo, pirates attacked
magnificent galleys, sailing before the wind
to Spain and the Thames. Like the brave foxes
they were, they reveled in bold and clever combat.
They were the prodigal sons of the sea. They
played an honorable game, and never took pride
in mere blind massacre.</p>

<p>One can imagine how the terrors of the sea
would have been increased if a few years more
of peace had permitted Germany to forge new
weapons. Of her liners and cruisers she has
picked the most powerful and rapid, and has said
to them: “Kill, sink, and fun away!” Nothing
is sacred to the barbarians of Rheims and Louvain,
neither cathedrals nor the routes of the sea.
What would not have been the horrors of this
privateering war if William II himself or one
of his lieutenants had had control of these maritime
massacres? Before them the grisly imagination
of the Middle Ages would have paled. What
crimes will the Germans not commit when they
realize that they are conquered?</p>

<p>Honor to the officers of the <i>Emden</i>! They have
destroyed ships, but they nobly refused to commit
the crimes commanded by their master. They
generously spared the lives of the sailors who
were at their mercy, and blood does not dishonor
the tale of their exploits. Doubtless the praise
of blood has disgraced them at Berlin, but the
fraternity of sailors does not condemn them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>England accepted the challenge. Over the vast
expanse of ocean she deployed her cruisers,
launched them forth on the path of the marauders,
and ordered: “Suppress them!” No pardon, no
weakness! The Emperor at Berlin had revived
the law of blood; so one took vengeance on his
satellites. They all disappeared.</p>

<p>The last victim, the <i>Emden</i>, suffered the doom
which it had so often inflicted. It had hunted
down twenty harmless steamers, and was then in
pursuit of a British convoy. To-day, broken, lying
on an Indian reef, it serves as a reminder to
wandering sailors. First they will salute this
heroic prow, which knew how to die and how to
redeem its enterprise from ignominy. Then they
will give thanks to the fate that had them born
of another race than the German.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Strait of Ithaca, 30 November.</i></p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief has ordered the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>
to leave its Adriatic station—Otranto,
Fano, Albania—for an anchorage in the
Ionian Isles at Arkudi.</p>

<p>We go a short distance out to sea before approaching
the maze of islands. To the north disappear
Corfu, Paxo, and Anti-Paxo; to the south
rise Saint Maure and Cephalonia; the great wall
of the Orient covers the east; all the landmarks
of our course are slowly displaced, giving way to
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>The officers of the watch pore over the chart.
This great white sheet with its fine print indicates
the contours, the data, the dangers, the routes.
To those who do not know how to read it, it is
nonsense; but its marks are our gospel. By its
fine and intricate lines we can foretell how easy
our voyage will be and where the dangers lurk.
We sometimes think of the mariners of old who
had no other guide than Providence. Reading
these charts we wonder whether these regions
were loved or feared, and whether, before risking
his life there, the pilot invoked Neptune or the
Virgin of the Waves.</p>

<p>We to-day are not so uneasy. Sky and sea are
smiling. There is something treacherous in those
blandishments of Nature, which recall the delights
of autumn and yet suggest the coming of winter
frosts. Their last tenderness is fragile.</p>

<p>Here we are in the strait of Dukato, between
Saint Maure and Cephalonia. It is a splendid
boulevard. To the right, Ithaca, Ulysses’ native
land, lies reddish brown under the sun; to the left,
lie jewels of rocks and liquid paths more delicate
and beautiful than remote trails in the depths of
woods; before us a cluster of islands with names
from the musical language of the rhapsodists—Arkudi,
Meganisi, Astoko. And like a highly
polished tapestry, the marvelous mountains tower
above the water, blue and crowned with light. The
sea has the hue of mother-of-pearl; the sky is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
pale, the islands are veiled in faint color; the
gods have composed these tints, outlines and
places into a perfect fairyland.</p>

<p>Space seems to have a divine soul, of unknown
substance. The eyes are ravished, the blood exhilarated.
When Homer sang the return of
Ulysses, the Ionian gods gave him a flexible and
sonorous language. That secret the men of our
times have lost, they must pause feebly on the
threshold of the inexpressible. Surely Ionia was
the garden of the gods.</p>

<p>The cruiser, slender and swift, glides between
these historic shores, which have seen the barques
of the Achæans, the triremes of Rome, the Venetian
galleys, the ships of the Crusaders and the
feluccas of Barbary. In our wake have passed
generations of pilots, who came from regions
where the sea is evil, and who laughed with delight
in this sailors’ paradise. Why should they
not all—poets or merchants, pirates or soldiers—celebrate
these delights and long to remain here?
Blundering through schoolbooks, I have hated the
very name of Ithaca; I have cursed Olympia—when
it was assembled in a detestable book. Since
then I have seen all the most perfect skies; my
eyes have exhausted the miracle of light. And
yet it is here that I place the cradle of the gods.
When the fancy came to them to descend to earth,
where else should they have lighted but on majestic
islet, like Juno on a steep bank made by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Vulcan? Was it not in this fair atmosphere that
Apollo shook out his radiant locks?</p>

<p>And is it not this sea that gave birth to Venus?
How happy he would be who could catch the secret
of the outline and color play on this sea? Her
fish are more beautiful in tint and form than the
loveliest animals. Her plants have a rich metallic
luster, with lines and curves that no land plants
approach. The men who frequent her, the cities
she laves, are fortunate. All beauty comes from
the sea; every vital germ has floated in her depths.
And the subtle intuition of the race of Homer,
who gave divine form to symbols, made the goddess
of life and beauty spring from the Ionian
waves.</p>

<p>Aphrodite! Triumphant, naked, I see you
emerging from the transparent blue sea: you
stretch your soft limbs under the caress of light.
You open your enchanted eyes upon an earth
where men, harassed by the ugliness of their souls
and the futility of their labors, stretch their hands
madly toward your eternal beauty! You go to
meet them. It was here you made your first appearance
on our earth. Blessed be the Greeks,
your sponsors, who chose this cradle for you!</p>

<p>And at this moment, when yonder on the field
of murder the German ruffians are trying to destroy
everything that is beautiful, everything to
which you have given birth, I understand more
clearly the patrimony which the French are called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
upon to defend. O Aphrodite, you extend across
the ages your protection to France, your child.
From this spot have come that clear thought, that
delicate feeling, that fertile vision, which you
loved in the people who nourished you. As a
humble defender of that beauty, born of the bridal
of sea and sun, a Frenchman thanks you for what
you have given him, for all that which is now in
danger of destruction; he salutes you in passing,
Ionian Aphrodite, and wishes he could see the
very circle of gold where the Greeks have placed
your birth.</p>

<p>Do not think it is the force of antique memory
alone that has produced this adoration of mine.
From the bridge where I am carefully guiding the
cruiser through the windings Ulysses loved, I see
on deck a thousand sailors, silent and attentive.
They have stopped talking and laughing, and no
longer turn their backs to the too familiar sea.
To-day a great silence hovers over these Bretons,
these Flemings and Provençals. In what naive
way are they absorbing the beauty before their
eyes? They are not acquainted with the poetry
and the prose which have endowed me with this
ancient heritage. There they are, however, with
wide eyes, lost in admiration. Beauty could not
be celebrated more significantly than in this
stupor of theirs. Their souls, I imagine, imprisoned
in dark dungeons, unconsciously regret
the speed of our passage. Their emotions are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
profounder than mine; theirs rise from depths
where are no words to translate the mystery.
When you do not understand a thing, you discuss
it; but you are silent when it is revealed. All
the sailors are silent. Beauty has just made itself
one of their souls’ memories.</p>

<p class="right"><i>At sea off the Peloponnesus, 2 December.</i></p>

<p>After so many weeks of cruising, without contact
with the world, we had hoped to enjoy a few
days of rest at Malta, a favor which the Commander-in-Chief
grants to weary ships. We
cherished the illusion that he had had us come
so that he might deliver his communications to us
and send us quickly on our mission. But in the
navy one must never hope unless one wishes to
be deceived. Hardly had we arrived at the anchorage
of Arkudi when the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> was
charged with an urgent mission on the other side
of the Balkan peninsula, to Saloniki. Regretfully
she takes the southern route, winds around Greece
and the Peloponnesus, turns towards the north,
and through the mazes of the Ægean Sea seeks
the road to Thessaly.</p>

<p>Our faces and eyes begin to show their weariness.
It is not without betraying the strain that
the stokers before their furnaces, the engineers
before their pistons, the gunner lookouts before
their guns, have lived this interminable length of
days and nights, alternating between heavy labor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
and broken rest. The air between decks becomes
heavier and more stifling with each passing day;
dust and heat lie over everything, and one is as
weary after a heavy sleep as at night on a railroad
train with all the windows closed.</p>

<p>Everyone wonders whether we shall ever have
the pleasure of engaging these Austrians or
Turks, who hide in corners out of reach and send
only submarines against us. The submarines are
there; they are everywhere, they are nowhere. We
stretch out our arms in the empty air; we strain
our eyes in looking for the hiding enemy; and suddenly
into the side of the vessel passes the wound
that has no mercy. And it all happens in silence,
for the naval warfare of this age is dumb.</p>

<p>I should only be tedious if I told in detail all
the vain pursuits of our chases in the upper Adriatic,
of patrols by night, of the sunrise, the light,
the dusk. The days stretch hand in hand in a
gray undulating vista across the water, at the end
of which vanish the last hours we passed in
France.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief has cheered our dejection.
The mission which takes us to Saloniki
will take us later to Marseilles. That at least is
the hope contained in our instructions. And we
will be allowed to take a rest while we are in
France. Everyone builds visions, calculates the
time, and persuades himself that the Christmas
holidays will find him again with his family. Already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
fathers seem to be caressing the fair heads
of their children before the fireplace, husbands
and lovers are trembling with a grave joy at the
thought of this homeward voyage, a simple enough
episode in our vagabond career, but charged with
emotion because of the suffering of yesterday and
the dangers of to-morrow. No one, however,
dares complete these castles in Spain; too many
miscalculations have marked our existence, as it
is. As for me, who for eleven years have passed
no single Christmas Eve in France, can I believe
that a freak of war will grant me this happiness
denied me by peace?</p>

<p>While we wait, each turn of the screws takes us
further from France. Sparta, Cythera, the Cyclades,
Corinth and the Piræus; these are the
names which the officer of the watch gives to the
lands that in turn come to salute us from the
horizon. At the end of the map are marked the
Dardanelles and Constantinople, other boundaries
of this world war. Our cruiser has left the regions
of danger in the Adriatic, and advances as
fast as possible towards the waspish Turk. We
move among beautiful scenery. Our eyes seek
out a lighthouse on some island of celebrated
name; our lips pronounce the name of some cape
which the poets have made famous; we maneuver
our engines and helm in an archipelago of tabernacles:
Cythera, the temple of Venus, and Delos,
the homeland of Apollo; Sparta, with austere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
countenance, and Athens, the rose of antiquity.
Why cannot the sailor enjoy this dry, pure
December weather? Under his feet the noble
cruiser quivers. During his lookout, he smokes
a light fragrant cigaret, and his thoughts, fluid
like these pale curls of smoke, in happier times
would have drifted back to the legendary epochs
of old. But no human evil darkens the shining
skies. For Austrian or Turk we must not cease
to watch. I do not dream of complaining of that,
for undoubtedly these hours portend violent homesickness
for me.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Gulf of Saloniki, 7 December.</i></p>

<p>According to the schedule of watches I am in
charge of the entry into the Gulf of Saloniki.
From two to six o’clock in the morning I have
directed the ship in this funnel of water, without
lighthouses, with treacherous currents, at the end
of which lies the much coveted city, that apple
of discord between the Eastern peoples.</p>

<p>A treacherous fog sleeps on the surface of the
water and shrouds the shores. Above it the moon
dominates the heights and sheds its idle sparkling
rays on the snows of Mount Olympus, Pelion and
Ossa. Between the mists on land and the starry
mantle of the sky, these peaks, whitened by the
snow and by the decay of their own glory, keep
watch in the deep silence. They are the only
guide of the sailor lost in the fog; the officer of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the watch and the young midshipman who assists
him do not take their eyes off these tutelary
presences. It is very cold. Towards four o’clock
a freezing wind blows from Thessaly, and
sharpens the edges of the snow to shining razors.
My hands freeze on the glasses, and my eyes shed
tears under the north wind. But one must forget
such miseries.</p>

<p>A faint paleness lingers in the East, and spreads
over the sky to our right. Straight ahead appear
low plains, dotted with fires. The dawn comes, a
moment full of difficulty and danger. My midshipman
and I steer the course among the shoals.</p>

<p>At the moment when the last tack opens before
us the roadstead of Saloniki, my successor comes
to relieve me. The sunrise has taken possession
of our world; the marvel of an Eastern morning
emerges from the shadows of the night. I go
quickly and drink a steaming cup of coffee, and
come on deck again, to admire as simple spectator
the panorama which I approached as pilot.</p>

<p>A stretch of frozen water, girdled with sands
and marshes, reflects an uncertain light. Our
prow breaks a way through the film of ice and
broken splinters fall back on either side, like the
crackling of frying cakes. Towards the mouth
of the Vardar, legions of birds are skating and
tumbling on this crust in which their claws can
get no hold—the tumult of their voices disturbs
the peaceful morning: fluttering moorhens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
raucous herons, ducks in triangular flocks, wake
and swarm about; rose-colored flamingoes poise
themselves, motionless and pensive, on their
needle-like legs, only a few meters from our
course.</p>

<p>As our cruiser, sparkling with dew and glistening
in the cold, penetrates farther into the white
fog, a town emerges from the vagueness. It is
still swathed in its morning gauze, its base is
plunged in the fog, but its minarets offer their
heads to the tints of the sunrise. One by one they
show their slender outlines; soon they can no
longer be counted for they form a forest of
columns over the city. Surrounded by massive
towers, the walls of the fortified castle on the
summit of the hill are bathed in light; and beyond,
stretching to the horizon, a desolate plain
without trees or houses carries the eye towards
Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, or the steppes of
Turkey.</p>

<p>Our anchor falls, and tears the parchment of
ice. At length, after so many miles and journeys,
the cruiser halts. All Saloniki is smiling under
the kiss of the sun. Close to the water, as along
all the Mediterranean shores, the buildings on the
quay show their black commercial signs, gold
façades of moving-picture palaces, and the white
stucco and marble of hotels and banks. The
streets, like dark tunnels through the mass of
houses, rise from the harbor and plunge into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
tiers of Christian and Jewish walls, up to the
heights of the great amphitheater, where are
massed the light blue Turkish cottages, surrounded
by cypresses and clusters of plane-trees.</p>

<p>An Orthodox basilica flaunts its humped dome;
the synagogue, geometrical and ugly, seems to
hide in a confusion of terraces; a Catholic church
raises its cross on a stone abutment; and the fifty
minarets, with their slender swelling and tapering
tops, point upward toward Allah’s heaven. To
the left, above the harbor, are tall smoking
chimneys of brick; these are the minarets of the
new god, industry, who has come at last to take
his place among the sleepy Orientals.</p>

<p>Since we carry the flag of war in neutral waters,
our cruiser must act with great scrupulousness.
Greece consents to observe toward our mission a
courteous hospitality, and we are careful not to
abuse it. Since the beginning of the war the
<i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> is the first belligerent vessel
to anchor in this cosmopolitan roadstead. All
the East shudders. From the Serbian and Turkish
storm clouds come bursts of thunder. Envies,
hatreds and hopes wait only the hour to explode;
Saloniki is a crossway where all currents collide.
The presence of French sailors on shore might
excite unpleasant demonstrations; the officers of
the cruiser and the authorities of the city agree
in refusing permission to sailors and officers to
land until new orders arrive. This restriction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
does not include couriers, or negotiators, who are
protected by the diplomatic immunities.</p>

<p>And here we are, imprisoned only a few fathoms
from shore. Weary with walking the steel deck
of the ship, we were rejoicing at the thought of
getting acquainted with softer ground. After the
glittering sea our eyes longed for the peaceful
sights of the streets or the fields. We abandon
hope of these meager pleasures, and, like Tantaluses
of the sea, try to satisfy ourselves with the
attractions in the roadstead.</p>

<p>From morning until evening, and up to nightfall,
the harbor caiques come out to the French
ship, besieging her and trying to fasten to her.
But the same orders which forbid our visiting
Saloniki in turn forbid access to the ship. No
cajolery softens the officials; they repulse the
most impudent attempts; and the rush of the
barques is broken against our armor-plate.
These resemble the narrow caiques of Constantinople.
The people are curious as only the
Easterners know how to be; they come in little
groups, not haphazard, but according to race, beliefs,
or opinions. The different groups correspond
to the diversity of the city, where under
the same heaven the mosques, the temples, the
basilicas and the churches, adore so many different
gods.</p>

<p>Large numbers of Greek soldiers with tanned
faces come to observe us. To free themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
from the menace of war, they have hired boats
together and come out to see what sailors look
like who for four months have followed this profession
of fighting. Later in some village of
Bœotia or Locrida, they will relate to a rural
audience the talk they had with sailors from
Cornouailles or Provence. But between these two
tribes of simple souls there is no common
language to make intelligible conversation. An
animated pantomime—sounds, grimaces, smiles,
which everyone understands—has to serve. A
finger is pointed towards the Dardanelles or Constantinople;
another indicates the Adriatic; some
comedian from Marseilles cries “Pan! Pan!”
and a Theban gunner answers “Boum! Boum!”
Great shouts of laughter burst from them.
Hearts, if not lips, speak the same language.</p>

<p>Hearing this wild laughter, a crowd of Turks
in black jacket and spotless fez, come round us
silently. Their caiques are polished and painted
green. Formerly these men were masters in
Saloniki, but German duplicity launched their
country into an adventure which lost them their
fortunes. To them our flag is accursed. If some
Turkish mine, wandering from the Dardanelles,
should rip open our hull before their eyes, I swear
they would raise to Allah strident cries of gratitude.
But they are helpless and morose.</p>

<p>Their spite is only increased by the attentions
we get from the friends of France. Some Englishmen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
for instance, with their short pipes between
their teeth and their chests open under a soft
shirt, row about in pirogues; their bright eyes
admire the cruiser as an instrument of sport, and
the sailors as men who play the game of death.
Passing, they rest their oars in front of the
officers, and shout a “Hip! Hip! Hurrah!” at
once emotional and precise, just as they might hail
some cricket or football team.</p>

<p>Pretty Greek girls, with pure profiles and sly
glances, add smiles, showers of flowers, and the
brilliance of their new gowns to the enthusiasm
of the men; as they leave, their gloved hands
throw towards the cruiser kisses which they think
are unperceived; but our glasses miss nothing.</p>

<p>Serbs with tragic faces, with sunken and burning
eyes, come to get new courage from contact
with the French Navy. At this very moment their
country is prostrate before the Austrian. Our
flag comes to tell them: “Do not despair!” and
they respond to our friendly salutations with pale
smiles.</p>

<p>Quite at their ease, some Russians push their
way among the crowd of barques. Whether their
territory be invaded or not, whether their troops
advance or retreat in the varying fortunes of this
war, the Russians suffer neither extreme anguish
nor extreme joy. They are quite serene. A cloud
effaces the sun, but does not extinguish it. A
reverse may annoy Russia, but she can wait; her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
victories will be the work of time. With a grand
viva on their white teeth they salute their comrades
of the great war, and then stay still,
smiling.</p>

<p>These vivas excite ferocious glares in many an
eye. Crouched on the benches in the boats are
old Ottomans of Bagdad, or Mecca, or Erzeroum,
who are telling over a shining chaplet of coral
or nuts. These men are incorrigible. From their
half shut lids, between their full lips, they dart
towards the <i>Roumis</i> looks of hatred and imprecations.
They glide at a distance of several meters
from us, and do not stop their boat. The glances
we are exchanging with our friends are profound,
and charged with significance; the Mussulmans
turn their eyes away to pretend indifference, but
their rage is betrayed in the movement of their
fingers which miss several beads at a time on their
rosaries.</p>

<p>And what of these swarms of Germans,
merchants, spies or fomenters of trouble, who
crowd into the boats and instal themselves under
our guns, to study the cruiser and the sailors?
Here are these smiling but shameless faces, their
eyes hidden beneath round spectacles, with which
Germany blinds the world. Some of them, accustomed
to this work, photograph us, enumerate
our guns, observe our system of surveillance and
protection. Before evening, telegrams in cipher
will carry to Berlin all this information. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
do it without shame; their disdain insults us with
its impunity. Is not our territory invaded? Are
not our Russian Allies harassed in Poland? Did
not the British fleet, only a month ago, lose ships
like ours off the coast of Chile? Have not our
Serbian friends been driven back by the Austrians.
“Germany over all!” We hear the arrogance
they do not express. One of them dares to throw
on deck a newspaper written in French. Attracted
by the language, a sailor brings us the paper.
But it comes from the press of the Wolff Agency;
quibbles, monstrous lies, written in a French that
would make negroes laugh, are dished up to the
Levantines by the Teutons. We do not even want
to shrug our shoulders; that would make these
Germans who are watching us too happy. One
among us rolls the sheet into a ball and throws
it into the water; our impassive glances pass over
these Germans encrusted along our hull. But
under our uniforms our hearts beat a little faster.</p>

<p>A new arrival distracts us from these unpleasant
neighbors. The children of the French
school, conducted by French monks, bring us their
rosy faces. Instead of games in the schoolyard,
they have been rewarded with a view of the great
ship, the ship which brings into the harbor the
majesty of the great unknown nation. The ancestry
of these children is diverse; their parents were
born in Armenia, in Syria, in Thrace or Macedonia,
but the gentle hand of France has already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
moulded their minds. They laugh with pleasure,
their eyes show animation and clearness, traits of
French thought. They rise and sit down again,
curious to see everything, disappointed in not
coming aboard, boisterous and friendly. When
they go back regretfully in the twilight, they crane
their young necks after us for a long time, and
suddenly their young voices chant a thin but
touching “Marseillaise.” Their voices are inharmonious,
their feeling breaks the verses, but
the distance and the hour give to the sacred
hymn an unbearable beauty. Like a perfume
from our native land it floats over the water, fades
away in the setting sun, and over there near the
jetties becomes so faint that we seem to be hearing
across space the song of our soldiers crouched
in the trenches.</p>

<p>At that moment the sun disappears, and the
cruiser makes its customary evening salute. Two
gun shots resound in the pure air; our brass band
plays the “Marseillaise;” the entire crew, hats off,
turn towards the flag, which slowly descends from
the top of the mast, brushes the bridge and guns
in passing, and the soul of its native land comes
to rest softly on the steel deck. During the night
hours this standard, rolled up, preserves the love
of France in its folds, and to-morrow, unfurling
them to the sun, it will make them float anew on
the seas we sail. Every evening and every morning
in the wandering life of the sailor, these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
religious moments bring together Nature and
Country, the two eternities; more religious even
to-day in the presence of a thousand witnesses
who are deeply moved. Standing, uncovered, all
our comrades turn their gaze towards the tri-colored symbol,
tinted with the blood, the purity,
the hope, of our native land. In fury our enemies
turn their heads away. The colored flag descends
gracefully, smiles at us, but sets the others at
defiance.</p>

<p>The water, purple for an instant, darkens and
freezes. Our steam cutters disperse the boats,
for the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> must be solitary
through the night. In this country where so many
thieves prowl about, vigilance must not be relaxed.
The German boats do not want to go. We jostle
them, chase them, and soon the spies’ faces have
been cleared away from the approaches of the
ship.</p>

<p>The night lights are lit in Saloniki; its quays
are blazing, its slopes are flaked with light; the
highest mingle with the stars. Dark and silent,
the cruiser takes up her sentry duty; the roadstead
is fast asleep, and the cold gradually covers
it with a new shroud. On board it seems as if
everything slept too, but the eyes of the lookouts
never close, and the flag of France can repose
in peace.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span><i>Pointe Kassandra, 10 December;<br>
<span class="padright">On the Fight in the Falklands.</span></i></p>

<p>What a fine revenge! The German squadron
was sailing down the American coast. In this
vast ocean she thought she had realized the ambition
of the Kaiser: “The future of Germany is
on the sea!” Admiral von Spee, the herald of
Teutonic glory, was unfurling in the harbors of
Chile the standard he said was invincible when
a telegram from Berlin recalled him, probably to
the North Sea, in order to add the strength of
his cruisers to that of the fleet at Kiel.</p>

<p>The <i>Scharnhorst</i>, the <i>Gneisenau</i>, and two small
cruisers began to double Cape Horn. They
cleared the spur of the American world. I myself
long ago went through the tempests and frosts
which must have enveloped the German squadron
in these windy seas. She reached the Atlantic,
and turned towards the north. On the map of the
world the Admiral’s pencil had traced the routes
leading to the Antilles, to the Azores, to the
United States, to Ireland, and the northern latitudes
of Norway, en route for the tunnel of the
German <i>chenaux</i>. Protected by the luck which
had followed him from China and Tsing-Tao, he
expected no disaster.</p>

<p>In the South Atlantic the British leopard had
placed his paws on the Falkland Islands; he had
been foresighted enough to store there immense
reserves of coal. The <i>Scharnhorst</i>, the <i>Gneisenau</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
and their companions, made for this valuable
booty, which they counted on seizing and stripping;
for the place is as lost on the ocean as a
helpless vessel. The German sailors, as they approached,
had all the pleasure of playing a
legitimate bad turn on their enemies.</p>

<p>But the wrath of Britain had launched on the
sea great cruisers armed with <i>fouet</i>. Their orders
were to discover these malevolent beasts, to chase
and to scourge them to death. From the Mediterranean
and from the English coasts, their greyhounds
started on the merciless hunt, and swept
the ocean as with a rake. Every time they put
into port, they filled their magazines, they listened
eagerly to the news of the world, and sailed ever
farther south. When they learned that their game
had turned along the American coast, they prepared
for the grand hunt, assembled, and
anchored in the Falkland Islands, in order to coal
by night and lose no instant.</p>

<p>How strange the fate of ships at sea! Twenty-four
hours later, and the coaling would have been
done!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the dawn of the next day, the lookouts on
the Falklands saw the columns of smoke from the
enemy ships in the distance. They came on like
a cyclone. Admiral von Spee on his bridge was already
imagining the telegram which should announce
to Berlin next night his extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
prowess. But from the islands which they
thought were deserted, they suddenly saw emerge
in the morning light the prows of the great
cruisers with their powerful guns. He counted
them. He recognized their strength. His signals
ordered flight. But the English pack had sniffed
blood, and until evening it ran and killed.</p>

<p>I have just read the respectful words which,
like an epitaph, the London admiralty dedicates
to their fallen enemies. Admiral von Spee has
nobly ended a stainless career. Far away in the
midst of the beauty of the Levantine, the officers
of my cruiser at first rejoiced at the victory. Then
they saluted him, for one does not need to know
all the final details to respect an end so glorious
as his.</p>

<p>The <i>Scharnhorst</i> and the <i>Gneisenau</i> were
cruisers of our own class, enemies of our own
design. Why did they not choose us, three ships
with our six smokestacks apiece? The fight would
have been glorious, and the glory to the French.
Shall we never confront anything but a desert
sea, or invisible submarines?</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mediterranean, 13 December.</i></p>

<p>Our mission is ended; we are going not to
France but to Malta. The Cassandras were right,
and this twelfth Christmas holiday I shall pass
where.... Courage and patience! Our comrades
in the trenches are suffering in the slime and mud.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
We are commencing to freeze on a sullen sea.
Winter will be hard for all the sons of France.</p>

<p>For several days the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> has
displayed the flag along the Levantine coasts. It
has proved the vigilance of our country and her
attention to the great cataclysms which are preparing
in the East. It has encouraged the neutrals
and informed the Turk that his turn will soon
come. The cruiser has anchored nowhere. Her
elegant outline passed far from islands or coasts,
and the people who observed the smoke from her
six stacks, could prophesy the future from the
sight.</p>

<p>One morning we crossed the bay which is
bordered by three nations, Turkey at Gallipoli;
Bulgaria at Dedeagatch; Greece at Kavalla—respectively
hostile, doubtful, friendly.</p>

<p>Gallipoli: a rugged mountainous peninsula,
looking like Corsica. Behind its heights winds
the passage of the Dardanelles, the path to Constantinople.
For the moment this approach is
forbidden us, and our guns quiver in vain. France
and England wait their hour; the punishment of
the Osmanlis will come later.</p>

<p>Dedeagatch: a seaport which Bulgaria conquered
in the recent war. It is a badly situated
harbor on an unfavorable coast; it seems to be
surrounded by a desert; we can see immense
freshly plastered barracks. A prize of war, it is
filled with armament; as a maritime station it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
receives naval contraband for the Balkans. How
many ships have we not halted who gave this port
among their stopping-places? Our suspicions
were rife; we saw that through this port the Turks
were kept supplied. But Bulgaria remained
neutral, the ships’ papers had all the proper endorsements,
and we had to let them pass.</p>

<p>Kavalla, Thesos and Samothrace: Greek harbor
and islands. At the first the dissatisfied Bulgarians
cast envious looks; they are inconsolable
at having lost it at the same time as Saloniki.
It is one of the bones of contention in an East
which will never end its disputes. The name of
this city will be famous before the war is ended.
It was in the bosom of Samothrace that connoisseurs
of sculpture found the statue which is the
pride of the Louvre. In Paris at the head of a
staircase, the perfection of her draped figure, with
its graceful stride, delights the crowds who come
to see her. She symbolizes Victory. For having
placed her in the temple of her masterpieces,
France deserves to add a jewel to the crown of
this same Victory. She will not fail to do so.
Our wistful thoughts pass to the violet rocks
where the Victory slept under the earth, waiting
so many centuries until she should awake in a
French museum.</p>

<p>All these visions fade. Others succeed them,
and each one brings a new dream. On a heavenly
evening, one of the last fine evenings of the closing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
year, the cruiser passed Mount Athos, that
jewel of the Christian faith. Her slopes are like
a splendid robe sown with gems. The huts of
hermits and solitaires cling to the sharp edges
that the vultures and the eagles love. The pious
men, who pass their lives preparing for eternal
bliss, spend here their austere days, made fragrant
with prayer.</p>

<p>Lower down, the convents form a ragged girdle;
soft colors, blue, rose and faded green, give a
religious tint to the walls; men, clothed in black—to
represent the mourning for earthly passions—pray
there for the sins of the world; they live
on another planet, and the clamors of the world
die at the foot of their sanctuary.</p>

<p>Before these priests and seminarists our smoking
cruiser passes like a comet which comes from
the unknown and goes into the infinite. The priests
of Mount Athos salute us; they send up rockets,
pale in the twilight; they set off firecrackers and
Bengal lights, and perhaps their united voices
send us an affectionate welcome. But the maritime
comet passes; the noises reach it faintly,
as the voices of men must reach the celestial
altitudes.</p>

<p>Around a little cape appear huge convents, with
sparkling gold domes. They are beautiful and
desolate. The faith of the Eastern peoples has
raised these kremlins in the name of Christ, and
the setting sun wraps them in a fire more radiant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
than the kremlin of Moscow. Splendid color
bathes the mountain and its cluster of religious
buildings. As if to view the picture better, the
<i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> draws away; it moves between
the sun, hung in a glory of rose-color, and Mount
Athos, shimmering under the caress of the light.
With its cliffs shining and its ravines filled with
colors, it seems alive, and changes like a poignant
harmony of violins. Into the summit, the frosts
of December have driven a nail of snow, which
catches the changing smiles of the sun and reflects
them, soft and tender, into space. In a few moments
the violet color takes possession of the sky;
then it fades imperceptibly, and the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>,
for this night of the voyage, sails on
in a religious atmosphere.</p>

<p>That man is to be pitied who is not moved
by the enchantment of Nature, or who does not
know the great lessons of history. He is ignorant
of those pleasures that never fade. For fifteen
days the Ionian Sea has been surrendering to me
its secret of our inheritance from the Greeks.
Mount Athos and this fair evening reveal to me
another heritage, that bequeathed by Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Long ago from the deserts of Palestine a voice
was lifted among the Roman multitude. It
brought back to earth those transcendant archangels
whom the children of Cain had banished.
The archangels are named Goodness and Justice.
I will not pursue the story of their martyrdom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
here on earth. Like harmless little animals at
bay before ferocious beasts, they have suffered;
their hearts and bodies have bled; and the wicked
boast that they have driven them from the world.</p>

<p>But a nation was found to receive these two
trembling angels in her maternal hands. She revived
them in her bosom; from their lovely touch
she got the courage to suffer, and as the first
Christians threw themselves to the torture rather
than deny the Divine Master, so France for more
than a century, has been willing to die in behalf of
her love for Liberty and Justice.</p>

<p>In the month of August, 1914, with sword on
high and bosom bare, she defied anew the perpetrators
of cruelty. Her people and her ministers
were not mistaken. Whether unbelievers or religious
men, their gospel and their justification
are those of the Galilean. It is indeed from His
divine parables, and not from the decrees of the
old Germanic god, that France has gathered the
flower which is planted in her crest. White and
incorruptible, this flower has closed its petals during
the weeks through which we are living; but
the German foulness shall not soil it, the shells
shall not cut its stem, and the dawn is not distant
when its opened petals will shed over the world
a sweet fragrance.</p>

<p>How beautiful France seems to me, and how
much in love with her I feel to-night! Frenchmen,
realize your good fortune to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
nourished by so charming a mother! In the womb
of antiquity were formed two priceless treasures:
Greek beauty and Christian virtue. It is our
France who has saved them from death. No people,
no territory, has been willing to receive these
heritages. Will all our blood suffice to pay for
this unhoped for splendor? Take care lest we
weaken. Under my eyes in the moonlight there
glide past ancient lands and islands, my memories
cross the centuries, rest like arches upon the supports
of these legends, and form a bridge which
leads far away to Jerusalem and to Athens.</p>

<p>Jerusalem and Athens! The barbarous Turks
and the ignorant Romans have stripped the gilt
from their glory. The sons of these two cities
did not know how to defend their patrimony, and
two thousand years of servitude, ruin and death,
have delivered their helpless peoples over to the
pity of history. Let us take good care not to
imitate them. Ignorant and barbarian, the Germanic
hordes menace us with their claws. The
gracious mind and exquisite body of France are
receiving the same affront as did her ancient
sisters. But in this case the same catastrophe
will not follow the same weakness.</p>

<p>Let us forget the frivolous thought and discourse
of our former days. Beauty must be
strong, and one can only smile when the fist is
heavy. Let us suffer; let us know how to wait.
From her dying sons France demands the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
to shine resplendent. How much shall we not
love her at the moment when, holding her spear,
she undoes her iron tunic, and offering to the
world a countenance flushed with feeling and eyes
profound with the agony of battle, says in a voice
broken with emotion and a smile brimming with
pride: “I have consented to shed blood! Let me
henceforth sow flowers!”</p>

<p class="right"><i>15 December, after the bombardment of<br>
<span class="padright">British harbors by German cruisers.</span></i></p>

<p>We too could acquire this glory of slaughtering
women and children. Who prevents us in the
Adriatic? To-morrow, if the French sailors were
bandits, the world would learn that their guns
had bombarded unfortified towns and the Dalmatian
Islands, and, protected by our cruisers’
strength, had eluded the vigilance of Austria.</p>

<p>Where on earth did the Germans learn warfare!
Does naval honor no longer exist among
them? I cannot believe it. There are tasks which
a sailor only accomplishes with rage in his heart,
and those who fired at Yarmouth, Grimsby and
Scarborough would ask pardon of God for the
crime which their Emperor commanded. Only
this man could have persuaded sailors to destroy
peaceful towns. The sound of those shells he
sent against a defenseless coast will whistle
through history round his accursed name.</p>

<p>You, commandant of the <i>Emden</i>, Admiral of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the cruisers sunk in the Falklands, captain of the
armed liners, I can imagine you shuddering in
disgust. Far away from the orders of your master,
you caused a spotless standard to be feared
on remote seas. Your conscience followed nobly
the rules of war. You conquered. You have been
conquered. In the great naval fraternity, no one
thinks of uttering your names without taking off
his hat to you. Before your defeat I would have
pressed your brave hands, happy to touch fingers
which no crime had sullied. But these cruisers
of the North Sea, reptiles which smell of putrefaction—let
them be tracked like stinking beasts—let
them be executed like apaches of the sea,
let them even be assassinated, and all sailors of
the world, neutrals as well as belligerents, will
think their punishment too good for their crime.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PART III<br>

<small>IN THE IONIAN SEA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="right"><i>End of December, 1914.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is nearly two o’clock in the morning. Far
to the south glides a line of phantoms. We
left Malta nearly a week ago; our monotonous
cruising has almost effaced the very memory.
It is a bad night. The rain is pouring down. The
wind whips into our eyes and onto our lips handfuls
of stinging nettles. I am shivering with cold.
I see the file of boats and masts tossed by the
swell. A British convoy is passing yonder, carrying
Hindu regiments from the sparkling seas of
Asia to the mists of Flanders. Its lights appear
and disappear as it pitches on the water, and it
does not notice our dark presence.</p>

<p>Although unknown as their guardians, the
cruisers have made the seas secure for these
transports, which could not resist the smallest
enemy torpedo. At a distance the French ships
accompany them, keeping between them and Austria,
and at the end of the regular course, give
over to other ships the duty of safeguarding them,
and move away to new tasks. The boats that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
come from India and Australia might fancy the
sea was empty and that good fortune was directing
them to port. On certain clearer days, when
they see almost imperceptible clouds of smoke, do
they guess that these come from one of their
guardian angels?</p>

<p>If our task consisted only in freeing the route
for these exotic allies of ours, there would be
reward enough for the difficulty of our labor. For
the first time in the history of men, a war summons
to Europe the children of immemorial Asia
as defenders and not as devastators. Let us be
the good artisans of this miracle.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Perhaps later, in some unforeseen voyage, I
shall pass through some bazaar on the banks of
the Ganges, or admire under the limpid sky the
mystic lines of a temple of Brahma. With his
head in a turban and his feet bare, a brown man
will approach me, his eyes will laugh with
pleasure at sight of a Frenchman lost among the
Hindu multitudes. His white teeth will light up
his smile, and he will murmur a few words of
the language which is so beautiful it makes one
tremble under every latitude:</p>

<p>“You, Frenchman! Paris.... Marseilles....
Good-day, monsieur!” this man will try to say.
I shall turn back and return his smile.</p>

<p>“Welcome!” I shall answer, “to one who greets
me in such pleasant words.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>And we shall walk together. This man, born
in the Punjab, the Himalayas or the Deccan, will
draw a marvelous fresco from the treasure of his
memories. He will tell me of the battle of the
Marne, the Oise or the Escaut. His eyes will
have a profound, fixed look from having traveled
in so many strange lands; his surprising metaphors
will make live again the cities he saw during
the intoxication of battle: Paris, Rheims,
Ypres, and so many others. At certain moments
he will take my arm, with respect at first, and
then with confidence, as the ghosts of the past
disengage themselves from a memory made
drowsy by the Eastern sun. All the epic drama
of Europe, already pale and unreal in his mind,
will revive for the benefit of my melancholy joy.</p>

<p>Perhaps too, if God is willing, my friend of the
moment will prove to have pushed his victorious
adventure as far as Berlin. He will draw from
his bosom a picture wrapped in rags, a post card
showing Unter den Linden or the Brandenburger
Allee. Under the blazing sun of India I shall
contemplate dreamily these grim buildings, and
my thoughts will make my heart beat heavily,
though I shall not betray my emotion.</p>

<p>“You see, monsieur, I got as far as that.”</p>

<p>He will put his finger on the Palace of the
Kaiser, and the dignity of men who have accomplished
great deeds will shine on his dark face.
Silently we shall gaze at each other, living a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
unique moment together. And then something
will break the charm, a street cry, a brawl of
sepoys, or the barking of dogs. The Hindu will
quickly hide the dirty picture, and will whisper
more quickly still: “Afterwards I came back, and
it was all over....”</p>

<p>We will go on a few steps, but he will remain
silent, having finished telling me all the romance
of his life. This romance will not return. No
Hindu will live it again. Head down and hands
folded behind my back, I shall find no words adequate
to this dream of his, or to the shattering
echo of our memories. On turning an alley, I
shall offer him my hand, which he will doubtless
kiss, and a few seconds later the eddies of the
crowd will have parted us forever.</p>

<p>Go, charming Hindu with your sunny soul, towards
the dream which enchants your slumber as
you are cradled in the rolling of the transport.
My lids burn and I am chilled to the marrow, but
you have nothing to fear. The cruisers watch
over your voyage and that of your brothers, for
you are sailing towards France; and carry her
your hearts and your arms, which are your only
riches.</p>

<p class="right"><i>1 January, 1915; three o’clock<br>
<span class="padright2">in the morning.</span></i></p>

<p>I come down from the watch. My boots, my
jacket, and my oilskins, drip in little dirty streams<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
on the linoleum; my hair is matted with salt, and
a bad headache, driven into my temples by the
rain and the squalls, prevents my getting to sleep.
The close cabin, hardly longer than a railway
compartment, smells of rubber, of tar and is rancid.
The steam heater adds a mustiness of hot
metal; the exhalations of boilers and engines filter
through the decks, and saturate everything with
a stale odor; the hull receives the eternal blows
of the sea’s battering-ram that storms angrily
against it. Through the joints of the port hole,
which is screwed down as tight as possible, ooze
threads of water which dribble along the wall and
form a pool. For I know not how many days,
the cabin has not received the least whiff of pure
air, and the electric lamp shines grotesquely in
the thick atmosphere.</p>

<p>With a towel, already soiled with coaldust, I
remove the crust of salt and soot that is stuck
on my face; then I wash my numb fingers in the
little pool that dances at the bottom of my basin.
Seated before my papers, my archives, I follow
the movements of the cruiser as it rides the squall.
Familiar lice and roaches risk timid voyages
across my desk. A bold gray rat gnaws old cigar
stumps and string in my waste paper basket. He
is not afraid of me, and I do not disturb his little
feast. What a sinister opening to the coming
year!</p>

<p>Where was I just now, on the bridge enveloped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
in water? In the interval of my watch the year
1914 joined the dead and 1915 lived his first moments.
A shower of rain gave its blessing to this
agony and this birth, and a gale with lungs of
steel howled with all its might. The clouds and
the sea made a chaos in which sailors had difficulty
in seeing anything, and the cruiser, tossed in the
hollow of the waves, could scarcely keep its course.
A hundred or two hundred miles away, other ships
were burying their prows in this cataclysm of
water, and struggling in the vast desolation.</p>

<p>The “naval army” is grieving over two recent
disasters—the torpedoing of the battleship <i>Jean
Bart</i>, and the loss of the submarine <i>Curie</i>. In the
brotherhood of the sea, the injury or disappearance
of a single ship creates a painful void.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The <i>Waldeck</i> did not take part in this last
Adriatic expedition, in which the fleet went once
more to tempt the Austrians. It had other tasks;
without it, the cruisers, battleships and destroyers
went up the liquid avenue, and spent some time
there. After a futile waiting they returned in
triumphant march to the strait of Otranto.
Slightly enervated by their unprofitable effort,
they were perhaps less strict in their vigilance,
and went slowly, disdainfully towards an enemy
restive for combat. But Austria, who accepted
no fight in the open, had despatched on their
course her venomous beasts. Through the lens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
of his periscope the commander of the submarine
at Cattaro saw the splendid array of battleships
rising on the horizon. The proud, thickset, form
of the <i>Jean Bart</i> led the fleet on the return as
it had led them on the ascent; on the mast floated
the flag of the Commander-in-Chief, and his
officers sadly surveyed the empty sea. But the
Austrian, crouched in the waves, trembled at the
approach of his unhoped for prize; each one of
the men enclosed in the flanks of the submarine
was keyed to the combat.</p>

<p>Oh! the minutes that these sailors and their
commander must have lived through! Must one
not envy them the emotion of their discovery and
of decisive action at last? Boldness and courage
erase frontiers; one feels jealous of an enemy
for the supreme beauty of a dangerous coup like
this. With all his energy concentrated in his eyes
and on his lips, the lieutenant of the Austrian
vessel watched the powerful battleships coming
towards him; he maneuvered in short zigzags, to
right and left, higher and lower, like an artist.
If he showed himself, he and his crew would meet
instant death. All the noblest and purest faculties
of the officer rose in him. When his calculations
and his experience told him that the <i>Jean
Bart</i> had reached the fatal place, he gave two
orders, and two torpedoes, at a few seconds’ interval,
threaded their way through the waves towards
the hull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>One passed harmlessly behind the <i>Jean Bart</i>,
and disappeared. But the other exploded against
her prow. The heavy sound warned the sailors
that the sea was seeking a victim. Through the
breach the water poured into the breast of the
battleship, tore open and twisted the compartments,
and did not stop until it reached a wall
strong enough to resist the pressure. Like a
stunned fighter, the <i>Jean Bart</i> lowered her forehead
and sunk her brow in the water. She carried
more than a thousand men, but not one showed
fear. Before disaster could happen, all of them
did their instant duty, and the ship survived. By
good luck the torpedo had been fired two or three
seconds too soon; otherwise it would have destroyed
her. In a few months she again took her
place among us.</p>

<p>The <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> has had her own risks.
Several times she has been attacked by submarines,
but doubtless her very familiarity with
this danger has kept her from being struck. Her
crew are happy over her having escaped the fate
of the <i>Jean Bart</i>. But what has the future in
store? Let us continue to do our duty; let us watch
with even greater vigilance, and keep our good
ship from the hospital or the grave.</p>

<p>Since this accident to the <i>Jean Bart</i> we scarcely
venture on the Adriatic except for very definite
purposes. The enemy submarines have demonstrated
their presence, which could be denied so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
long as none of our ships, through good fortune
or skill, had been actually hit. It is a habit of
men’s minds to depreciate the danger which does
not touch them. After the admiral’s ship had
been struck, the zone of operations was moved
to the south, in the Ionian Sea. The “beats” of
the cruisers are longer, and the weather is frightful.
This sea is a regular gathering-place for
the winds. Coming from the four quarters of the
horizon, the sons of Æolus meet here and riot.
The end of the Adriatic and Albania breed a keen
icy capricious north wind which descends at a
great velocity, rushing out of the corridor formed
by the banks, expanding suddenly in the open,
and turning the waves upside down. By way
of Epirus and Morea, the winds of the east and
southeast come from Syria and Asia Minor, and
raise the stormiest seas. Endless fogs are carried
over by the fringes of the simoon, from the hot
south and the sands of the Soudan and Libya.
And the strong west wind, born in the Atlantic,
blown over Gibraltar and Sicily, rushes up and
throws gigantic waves against the wall of the
Ionian Islands, thrusts them back, cuts them and
joins them again in wild and formless masses on
which we leap and roll as if intoxicated. We see
nothing but the gray elements of rain and wind,
mist and spray. The ships avoid these latitudes,
where few of the commercial routes cross, and
which our presence renders still more undesirable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
It is a sort of desert place in the city of the sea.
Sea birds accompany us no longer; they fly in the
heart of the gales. A troubled void, a journey of
the Wandering Jew, that is the present existence
of the cruisers.</p>

<p>Just now on going to the watch, my comrade
and I, in order to celebrate the New Year, took
to the bridge a bottle of champagne, a poor cheap
bottle of champagne, some renamed Saumur, for
our ship does not possess any rare vintage. In
the shelter of the navigation-house, five glasses
had been placed on the map of the Ionian Sea;
they covered Sicily, Apulia, Corfu, the Pelopennesus
and Libya; the bottle occupied the sector
of the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>, and in the storm
awaited the five officers on duty. A black and
icy rain was falling. The chill bit into one’s flesh.
When we stretched out our hands we could not
see the tips of our fingers. A dripping steersman
came howling in our ears—“Captain, it is midnight!”
“Lieutenant, it is midnight!”</p>

<p>Bracing ourselves against a gale which almost
tore us from the deck, we wiped our weeping eyes.
We could not all get into the shelter-house; a
group of two or three slipped in by turn and those
who were not drinking continued the lookout. We
stood under the wan streak of an electric light
among books, confidential documents, maps, not
daring to stir for fear of wetting these precious
papers. We uncorked the bottle, which in popping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
made a pretense of sparkling, like our own false
gayety. We raised the glasses. Drops of water
fell from our sleeves and our fingers shook. We
awaited the toast, but not one found anything to
say. France invaded.... War stretching into
the long future.... Our families, so far away....
So much sorrow.... No professional
pleasures, and no hope of battle.... Accursed
weather and a frozen body.... In our eyes
shone something moist which was not rain; we
were sad but tried to smile. The glasses trembled.</p>

<p>“To France!” I murmured at length. It was
the only brilliant thing to come to my mind. “To
France!” responded the others, and the glasses
chattered against our teeth. No one finished his
glass. After one swallow we could drink no more,
but set our glasses down anywhere. The wind and
rain rushed in by the half-open door, and one
after the other, with choking hearts, we resumed
our dim vigil on the bridge.</p>

<p>Two hours more before going below, two hours
of tempest and anxious revery! Like a star shining
in the midst of a hurricane, the mind watches
in a body worn with fatigue. Across space the
great tragedies of the dead year surge out of the
past, and assemble in the mind of an officer harassed
by the wind. Paris delicious in Spring
and Summer.... Plans for the future....
The thunder of Serajevo.... The knife struck
by Austria into the throat of Serbia.... The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
diplomatic storm.... The war.... The Prussians
near Paris.... The immortal Marne....
The Adriatic hunts.... Drowning Russia....
Unchained Turkey.... Serbia invaded and freed....
Dramas of the sea.... Five months of exhausting
cruises.... The submarine <i>Curie</i>....</p>

<p class="right"><i>3 January, after several watches<br>
<span class="padright2">and bad weather.</span></i></p>

<p>The <i>Curie</i>! Twenty days ago, I was talking
with her Commander, who confided to me his
hopes. A fine, intelligent-looking man, he thought
with vigor and spoke gently. He was preparing
a raid as far as Pola, an Austrian base, and gave
me the technical details, and the arrangements for
this remarkable enterprise. A reflective enthusiasm
brightened his talk. Such an officer on
such a boat, with the crew he described, was justified
in attempting the impossible. I envied his
good fortune.</p>

<p>But Fate, the god of sailors, did not wish him
to win. Wireless messages informed us that the
barrages had stopped the <i>Curie</i> in the very harbor
of Pola. Later the survivors of this epic adventure
will give the details of their audacity and
their failure. To-day they languish in some Austrian
fortress. God grant that some day I may
press the hand of the Commander.</p>

<p>All alone, like the lost child of the “naval
army,” the <i>Curie</i> had started through the dangerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
fields of the Adriatic. I do not know its route,
the alarms it had, the ruses it used. Moving by
night, hiding by day, darting its keen eyes over
the horizon, it went along the coast of Italy as
far as the Austrian line. At the end of the Adriatic
it moved among ambushes; every wave of
the enemy sea represented its winding-sheet.
With body and soul equally hardened, the twenty-five
men approached the hostile labyrinth. Their
joyous hearts endured everything—the irregular
meals, the suffocating atmosphere of the steel
prison, the smell of oil, the whiffs of hydrogen,
the sulphurous and oily vapors which make the
head heavy and turn the stomach, the alternations
of glacial cold and torrid heat as they came to
the surface or submerged, the alarms and the
dangers, the marvelous hope of penetrating the
strongholds where the Austrian battleships had
locked themselves in with a triple lock, the fear
of running aground on the threshold, and the
tempest of thought that crosses the minds of gallant
men at the moment of action.</p>

<p class="right"><i>6 January, 1915.</i></p>

<p>One day, at the end of their hunt for danger,
they see vague shadows on the horizon. It is the
Austrian coast; it is Pola. Faint streaks of smoke
hover over the further end of the well-guarded
harbor where the Commander imagines the fleet
to be. The prow of the <i>Curie</i> turns towards this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
cemetery; for whether it is their own or their
enemy’s; someone has to die in this adventure.
Officers and sailors make the great dedication together,
a generous offering of their youth and
strength to their remote native land. The
submarine submerges. They hear nothing more
except the lapping of the waves on the ship, the
purrings of the motors, as submissive as the obedient
souls of the men, and the brief orders of
the officer.</p>

<p>He and the others see nothing. But through the
periscope the land rises into view, the smoke becomes
black, the coasts reveal lighthouses, forts,
promontories, and at last he perceives motionless
masts. Between him and these masts lies the network
of dikes, barrages and nets; against him
the Austrian Argus levels a hundred eyes and a
hundred arms—torpedoes, mines, guns, outguards,
semaphores, and sentries. None of the sailors
hesitates. Motionless before their valves and
their hand-levers, they await the order of the man
who is watching, and long to anticipate his will
so that they can accomplish their task still sooner.
They maintain the profound silence which precedes
great deeds, and hope thrills in their hearts.</p>

<p>The steering-gear is handled, the manometers
announce the various depths; the submarine
touches bottom, and runs afoul on the shoals bristling
with traps. An even profounder silence settles
on all. Like statues of flesh, the men’s hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
are firm and their gleaming eyes are fixed on the
man whose eyes in turn remain rivetted to the
periscope. But one can guess from the quivering
of his forehead, and the sound of his voice, the
danger that approaches, the danger they are
touching, the danger they are passing. “After
God, the master on his ship!” says the naval
proverb. This officer is a god, whose exactness of
word and vision is responsible for the lives of
twenty-five men; through the magic of confidence,
they experience all his emotions.</p>

<p>The <i>Curie</i> has passed through. Obstacle after
obstacle has been overcome. Through the increasingly
bold behavior of their commander the sailors
guess that the prize is near. Sleeping at their
anchorage a short distance away, float the battleships.
Who would have thought that a submarine,
coming from the Ionian Sea, would ever penetrate
into the very heart of Pola? The Austrian crews
are off their guard; their officers, glass in hand,
are doubtless stooping over the maps, and joking
about the French Navy. It is a feast day. Whoever
is not on duty is amusing himself on land.
In the gay town toasts must be going round to
celebrate the German victories, and in the squares
the bands are playing Wagner or Brahms. Pola
resembles some pretty town of Gascony or
Provence, that is well protected from the enemy;
between the morning paper and the evening communiqué
she forgets the great drama of the distant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
war. But the <i>Curie</i> is moving about in the
depths of the roadstead.</p>

<p>From this moment, the wireless messages tell
us nothing; Austria acknowledges nothing. What
did our submarine do? Did she disable, did she
sink some ship that thought herself invincible?
Or else, tacking towards the battleships, was she
caught too soon in some treacherous barrage?
The last news told of her being stopped by the
steel meshes. Going or coming? The mystery
will be well guarded. What despair, what death
in the midst of life, when the twenty-five heroes
of the <i>Curie</i> understood that they could get no
further! They heard a grating along the hull;
it was the prow penetrating the mesh, like a fish
in the dragnet. Warned by this sinister sound,
the Commander tried to reverse the engine, but
the steering-gear at the side, with projections like
fins and gills, was already entangled in the metal
gauze. Then, however the <i>Curie</i> moved, the mass
of the net softly followed, bending without breaking
or permitting passage. How many times did
her Commander repeat his maneuvers in search
of safety? I do not know. What miracles of
ingenuity did he not employ? I do not know.
Every effort useless, he turned away his eyes, big
with horror, from the periscope to the interior
of the boat, and looked at his alert men, the great
engine which he had directed to the goal and which
would never return; he thought “We are lost!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>Did he pronounce these words? What if he
did not! Everyone understood them and forgave.
Since they had come either to die or to conquer,
they accepted death along with the officer, and did
not reproach him. They looked at each other with
eyes that were melancholy but not afraid. They
were merely regretful. They were ready for
asphyxiation, poisoning, hunger, thirst, drowning,
madness; all that was as nothing to the price of
their failure.</p>

<p>While this was going on, electric bells in contact
with the barrage, announced that something
had been caught in it. The lookouts exchanged
stupid glances, refusing to believe that it was a
submarine. At first they supposed that a snag
was moving the barrage, and were convinced only
when they saw the eddies, and the bubbles of air
on the surface which showed that a live thing was
struggling below.</p>

<p>The hypothesis of a French submarine never
occurred to them at all, and they telephoned the
Admiralty, which became anxious. Some submarine
of the station, returning to the fold, was
struggling in the barrage, the intricacies of which
it should have known. At once the chiefs summoned
all the officers of the submarines, prepared
to give a sharp reprimand to the foolish commander
who failed to respond, after they had
rescued him. But the officers all presented themselves.
At length they all admitted that, in spite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
of the improbability, the devilish Frenchmen had
reached the end of the channel. The admirals
were silent, as one is silent before a miracle.</p>

<p>How many hours did the <i>Curie</i> spend in trying
to break its bonds, like a noble stag stamping its
hoofs and tearing its legs? But they could be
saved neither by their knowledge, nor their
prudence, nor their perfect audacity. No other
crew, I swear, would have succeeded where they
were stranded. Exhausted, the steel fish slowly
rose to the surface.</p>

<p class="right"><i>8 January.</i></p>

<p>And the lookers-on saw the boat that had come
from France. It was immediately showered with
shells from guns and mitrailleuses, but the sailors,
nearly asphyxiated, opened the narrow panels.
Now that their death was no longer necessary,
they consented to live, and the volleys spared this
superhuman body of men who were surrendering.
Pola assembled to see the landing of the sailors
who had emerged from so impossible a feat. The
survivors passed along, still staggering from their
extraordinary adventure. I wager that the crowd
made not a single unfriendly gesture against these
martyrs. Perhaps, before these faces, so handsome
and so terrible, and these ragged garments,
the women crossed themselves, and the men
saluted. The sailors of the <i>Curie</i> did not then
receive the benediction of France, but in the respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
of their conquerors they read the magnificence
of their unsuccessful enterprise.</p>

<p>And we who sail the Ionian Sea award this crew
the palm with invisible leaves. When in the middle
of the storm, our imaginations begin to reconstruct
this epic drama of our brothers, we envy
them, we begrudge them the feat, and would exchange
all the vagabondage still before us for
the few hours which those men lived.</p>

<p>The admiration is not unjustified. In these days
our enthusiasm is not spent foolishly. For the
citations and the orders of the day create a roll
of gallant men before whom one prostrates oneself
almost as before angels. Before the war the
most hopeful of us scarcely suspected that our
wonderful race would prove so courageous. If
we are so astonished and delighted, the world will
be too. We live in an age which the Greeks would
have peopled with demigods, and a Homer who
attempted their celebration would scarcely have
found words adequate to hymn them.</p>

<p>The fecund soil of France has given birth to
all the virtues. There each soul becomes a tree
on which flowers have suddenly grown. The
coward becomes bold; the egoist, generous; the
atheist kneels before his country. I fear that these
miracles are not so evident to Frenchmen living
on their native soil, but the exiled sailors are not
deceived. And yet all they have to go by is papers
and letters, black print upon white. Across these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
lines passes a breath like the pure wind which
sweeps a dark sky. All becomes clear and bright.
Perhaps one must be far away to admire the halo,
shining fairer hour by hour, which encircles the
destinies of one’s country. The faults and errors
vanish like dark spots on the gorgeous disk of
the sun. Every French thought is a ray from
a rising star. These rays are so warm, and carry
so far, that they reach even us who live among
the storms.</p>

<p>Day before yesterday I read two letters from
the same mail. The weather was like the end of
the world. Formless and gray, the mists poured
over the troubled sea; the cruiser struggled in a
circle of specters with liquid hair, who smothered
the dying light. The two envelopes lay on my
desk, that rolled as the ship tossed. In ink upon
expensive paper, the first one contained an address
in angular handwriting; the second was on
cheap paper, in which the wavering writing had
made holes. One gave forth a delicate perfume,
which reminded me of the fair Parisian who alternated
between love for her Pomeranian and
the pretentious inanities of tango teas. To her
husband, an encumbering sort of toy, she accorded
only what the Civil Code ordered in the way of
marital duties. The second envelope had no perfume;
perfumed paper is unknown to the puny
little stenographer whose services I made use of
in Paris. She was a fierce anti-militarist; her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
father and her brothers talked themselves hoarse
in meetings at the Salle Wagram, and I was often
shocked at her anarchistic ideas.</p>

<p>In the first excitement at the end of July, it
happened that I saw both women on the same
day.</p>

<p>“You will see,” said the first woman, resting
a careless hand on my shoulder, during the tango
“you will see that the common people will sabotage
the mobilization. These fellows are rebels.
Sooner than fight they will surrender to William.”</p>

<p>To one of my subsequent questions she replied
haughtily:</p>

<p>“My husband? My husband? What are you
talking about? All the same they will not have
the audacity to call out men of thirty-five!”</p>

<p>And, after a silence:</p>

<p>“I do not expect to lose him. We should go
to the country.”</p>

<p>The tango was finished without another word.</p>

<p>That same evening the stenographer brought
me some pages. She was flushed, and her eyes
flamed. I counted the pages carefully and paid
her. Without looking, she pocketed the money,
and remained standing, trembling. I was careful
not to say a word.</p>

<p>“And you?” she said at last. “Would you go?”</p>

<p>“Certainly!”</p>

<p>“Well! It’s your war!”</p>

<p>“My war?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“Yes! The war of the upper classes, the
officers, the idle people who carry swords!”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>“Certainly it is! You are going to make us
kill ourselves to the last man, so that you can
be masters afterwards.”</p>

<p>“All the same, mademoiselle, you will keep your
father and brothers. Their opinions compel
them....”</p>

<p>“Hey? What’s that you say?” interrupted the
mutineer. “They have ordered their new boots,
and papa refuses to guard the railroad. He wants
to go to the front. But it is not for you they
fight, ladies and gentlemen, but for France!”</p>

<p>God forgive me, I found nothing to reply. A
few minutes later, having descended several steps,
she became timid and correct, and leaned against
the banister.</p>

<p>“You are going far away, sir.... The sea is
terrible!”</p>

<p>“It is my profession.”</p>

<p>“One can be drowned.”</p>

<p>“One can swim.”</p>

<p>“Would you be happy? Should you like it?
Anyway, forget what I said. Can one write to
naval officers?”</p>

<p>“They may even answer.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Her sharp heels rang on the staircase. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
every month since she has written two pages to
her patron, the officer, the bourgeois.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“My father is happy,” says the letter in the
last mail. “They have put him fifty kilometers
nearer the Boches. My young brother has had
his foot frozen, the other has lost his left arm,
and won the <i>Croix de Guerre</i>. You see that all
my people are well. They are bored in the
trenches. They would like very much to get at
the Germans. The officers say that that will come
later. One believes them, doesn’t one, because
they get themselves killed first, and do not risk
their men’s lives? You are very fortunate to be
an officer, and if in the navy they are like what
they are in the army, I am well content with
France which....”</p>

<p>Thus writes my rebel of former days; sincere
to-day as then, she is the happier now for hating
nobody.</p>

<p>“My dear husband,” says the perfumed letter,
“received a splinter of shell in his right shoulder.
In fifteen days he can return to the front. I am
obliged to feed him, for he has difficulty in using
his other hand; he lets things drop into his beard,
which is not nice. I should like to keep him, but
I do not dare tell him so. I am not a heroic
woman, and I am not afraid to acknowledge the
fact to you. However, when I see these poor
little soldiers in my hospital, who smile so sweetly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
in spite of their suffering, I understand that I
have no right to keep my husband. If you could
see these dear wounded men! They thank you so
bashfully. They find simple words to express
great things, and they look at their nurses with
such kind eyes, and so respectfully that I feel
unworthy to dress their wounds....”</p>

<p>Thus my idle lady. I am sure she has quite
forgotten her old bitterness. I do not care to
remind her of it.</p>

<p>All the letters that come from France are just
as good, and contain sentiments that do not surprise
me in the least. Wives, mothers and sisters
of fighting men, have learned the sorrow of
separations that may be eternal. Since my entrance
into the Navy, how many such letters have
I not received, each line betraying anxiety? But
they were written by women of the sea, if I may
so put it, women accustomed to anxiety. The
majority of Frenchwomen were not acquainted
with this style; but it did not take long for them
to discover it. For the same anguish creates the
same words.</p>

<p>These women hate war in the same way that
our women curse the sea; they as much desire to
keep their dear ones out of the terrible battle
as ours rejoice when they learn that we were far
away from a certain wreck or explosion. Their
hearts are tortured by that suspense which makes
them blanch at a telegram, and catch their breath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
at the sound of the postman’s step. Who better
than we naval men can understand the silent tears
which will be shed by all the beautiful eyes of
France?</p>

<p>By some secret sympathy the wives of soldiers
use the same words which used to make us dream.
They drive back their tears and try to smile; their
letters tell us news, slip in anecdotes, and are
silent about the mysterious scourge of the war.
They carry themselves bravely, but the tones of
their voices betray them. Near the beloved one,
sharing his danger, facing the same death, they
would be indifferent and cheerful. But they are
alone. They can only wring their hands and raise
them to God.</p>

<p>In times of peace only sailors were blessed with
the love of these Penelopes, these Hecubas, these
despairing Antigones; to-day this love is lavished
on all the heroes of France. If they die in battle,
the mourning in their homes will be like the
mourning in so many sailors’ homes: a dumb distress,
faces buried in hands, bodies shaken by
ceaseless sobbing. If they return they will see
what our eyes have seen on our homecomings—these
faces made sublime by the patient waiting,
these eyes grown larger, these lips closed tightly
on inexpressible suffering. They will know the
long embraces, in which arms are stiff as chains
of tenderness, and the mad beating of hearts,
broken by infinite joy; they will listen to words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
that are never heard by those who never go away.
Survivors, you will some day become acquainted
with the poignant sweetness of the homecomings
of cruisers, for to-day all the women of France
are the wives of sailors.</p>

<p>Henceforth you will appreciate the power of
simple souvenirs. A lock of hair, an amateur
photograph, a muslin handkerchief, a penny pencil
tooth-marked by some economical housewife—everything
becomes a souvenir, everything creates
homesickness. During long hours in the trenches
or on sentry duty, these little objects will take
you back to the sanctuary of your loves; you will
appreciate the bonds of affection, to which perhaps
you were careless because habit had disguised
their sweetness. In the muddy furrow
where your body is growing mouldy, and your
blood is freezing, these secret amulets will warm
your heart.</p>

<p>We too in our moving cabins keep priceless
treasures and talismans.</p>

<p class="right"><i>10 January.</i></p>

<p>On this damp steel vessel of ours, where sometimes
we are burning, sometimes frozen, the
weather and the salt air discolor and thin out
our memories. The faces that enchanted our lives
take on smiles that are a little faded, watch over
our weariness and our uncomfortable slumbers,
and hold with us silent conversations, in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
more is said than ever was said in other days.
One’s heart softens, one forgives, one makes new
resolutions. The defects of the loved one disappear
under new charm, and the proudest
among us reproaches himself for ever having
been rebellious.</p>

<p>After such conversations, the exile of the seas
pursues his monotonous task with a lighter heart.
The furnace of the engine-room and the icy bridge
are thronged with phantoms who alleviate our
austere labor with their invisible caresses. As at
the beginning of the war, I should like to present
a few pictures of the essentials of our existence,
in which we kill time in tedious activity. But I
can no longer do it. Nothing comes to me. The
résumés in which I sum up our daily activities
and which I extract from the log, are pretty significant.
They are somewhat like the movements of
a cloud, supposing it could think—its goings and
comings, its risings and descendings, without ever
being able to imagine either the causes or the
effects. Why should I not merely copy here the
journal of several days taken at random? The
date matters little; the explanations which I shall
add will apply just as well to past weeks as to
months in the future.</p>

<p>SUNDAY. Sailed to a rendezvous in the bay
of Katakolo where the fleet of battleships is stationed.
4.50 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>: anchored at Quilles S 77 E
of the light of Katakolo. 6.05 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>: got under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
weigh in line behind the <i>Courbet</i>; the <i>Renan</i> and
the <i>Democratie</i> behind us. The two other squadrons
to the south. Night cruise.</p>

<p>MONDAY. 5.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>: in sight of the light of
Katakolo. 3 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>: anchored at 1m.5 S 89 E from
this light. Boats in the roadstead: <i>Courbet</i>,
<i>Renan</i>, <i>Diderot</i>, <i>Danton</i>, <i>Condorcet</i>, <i>Mirabeau</i>,
<i>Voltaire</i>, <i>Paris</i>, <i>France</i>, <i>Patrie</i>, <i>Democratie</i>, <i>Republique</i>,
<i>Justice</i>, <i>Commandant-Bory</i>, <i>Chasseur</i>,
<i>Voltigeur</i>, <i>Lansquenet</i>, <i>Canada</i>. 4.45 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>: weighed
with the <i>Renan</i>. 6.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>: started on a route to
south and west of Zante. Night cruise.</p>

<p>It was one of those Sundays in the Navy when
everything is covered with gloom; weeping clouds,
high seas, whirling icy wind. We were sailing
steadily over a forsaken part of the sea, when
a wireless from the Commander-in-Chief ordered
us to the west coast of the Morea, to the bay of
Katakolo. The dripping officers looked up the
description and maps of this harbor we had never
visited. As what we had to call evening fell, we
approached the rendezvous. We could see nothing
there. The rain came down in torrents, shutting
out the view and almost the air and space.
Suddenly there appeared the vague outlines of
the ships, as if drawn in pencil and brushed over
with glue. So short-sighted were we that we went
near to them to be sure that these huge shapes
were not tricks of the rain. Cowering in the rain,
they seemed deserted, and we passed carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
between their motionless lines, as during a
thunderstorm a traveler makes for his home
through streets that are lined with houses set close
together.</p>

<p class="right"><i>15 January.</i></p>

<p>Our anchor fell, and we heard nothing but the
pattering of drops on the metal. As the night
deepened our ship and our neighbors seemed to
thin out like ink in a wash-basin; but the signals
flashed on the mast of the <i>Courbet</i>, the Admiral’s
ship. Red and white, they had difficulty in crossing
the rainy whirlwind, and their sparks made
even more sinister this winter twilight. They
ordered the squadrons to get under weigh. During
the night, which is favorable to surprise attacks,
the ships never stay in strange or open
roadsteads.</p>

<p>All together we weighed anchor, and took our
distances and our proper intervals. The night
had completely fallen, the storm was increasing
in violence, the unlighted ships groped about like
blind men seeking their places in a ballet. Immense
outlines approached, passed, disappeared,
in the evolutions of the night; an error in the
distance or route, a mistake in calculating the
phantoms which moved all together, might have
caused an irreparable disaster. At these movements
nothing but their work exists in the minds
of the sailors; family, country, war and affection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
are abolished; one is simply a part of his vessel,
like a gun or a smokestack.</p>

<p>While certain battleships, separating into two
groups, sail to the south as a reserve, the <i>Courbet</i>,
the <i>Waldeck</i>, the <i>Renan</i> and the <i>Democratie</i>, go
in Indian file on the parallel assigned to them.
One behind the other at a distance of a thousand
meters, pitching and rolling for two hours westward,
then two hours eastward, all night long
they struggle through the waves. Through the
stormy night the officers of the watch, in their
turn, attend to their professional duties. Sometimes
they lose sight of the shadow that is the
ship ahead of them, and fear they are not taking
the prescribed speed; they increase it, leaping
ahead into the blackness; the rain redoubles, and
they increase it again so as not to lose touch with
their neighbor; the rain lessens, and an enormous
mass, looming on the water, high in the air, rises
almost within touching distance.</p>

<p>It is the ship in front, which the clearing of
the rain suddenly reveals, and which we should
ram if we did not reverse with all possible haste.
Orders are sent to the engines, which slow down.
The dangerous mass buries itself in the rain; the
officer on watch is glad, and thinks: “All right
this time....” At this moment, to his right or
left, there emerges from behind a dark spot which
does not at all resemble the rain. The officer
observes it carefully. His inflamed eyes finally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
make out that the ship at the rear, which also has
lost us, has increased its speed, and is about to
ram us as we had just escaped ramming the other.
He puts on speed; the ship aft diminishes, recedes,
disappears in the darkness to fall back doubtless
in a few minutes on the fourth ship of the line,
which will have thought herself lost too, and been
about to seek her comrades in her turn.</p>

<p>In the deviltries of this bad weather the officer
in charge wears himself out solving these problems.
Every minute of his watch is accompanied
by a crisis, a pang, a cold sweat. His eyes meet
only the gale, the stabbing gusts of rain, and
downfalls of water. The hours pass. His eyes
become painful burning circles. When he tries
to sleep on his restless bunk, his eyes resist sleep,
a sort of nightmare, accompanied by the rolling
of the ship, makes illusory forms plunge before
him in the darkness.</p>

<p class="right"><i>18 January.</i></p>

<p>In the morning the three groups of ships returned
to the bay of Katakolo. This morning we
found delicious, because the sun, though invisible,
had whitened the edges of the clouds, and the
monotonous rain had given place to brief
showers; fragments of rainbow, scattered over
the network of the waves, brightened the gray
web of the sea. And land was near, fair, almost
gay, under the false smiles of day, after being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
lashed by so many weeks of rain. At the edge
of a little jetty some slender masts were swaying
like bushes; from the white houses of the port a
road emerged, winding among the rocks, the olive
orchards, and the herds, towards a town situated
on a hill. Green foliage covered the buildings of
this little town, which the distance rendered imposing.
Small imagination is necessary to give
grandeur to the stones in Greek lands; as our
eyes rested on these buildings, that were perhaps
very ugly, they sought there some temple with
classic colonnades or majestic portals. Illusion of
our memory! This town is named Pyrgos, this
province is Arcadia, and the brook which flows
into the bay was formerly celebrated by the name
of Alpheus; unconsciously we are paying its insignificance
the homage which has been won for
it by the divine liars of Greek poetry.</p>

<p>But why discuss such meager pleasures? This
coast and anchorage are pleasant; would it not
be more worth while to enjoy a few agreeable
hours? Moreover, our order for departure has
come, for it would be strange indeed for a cruiser
to remain forever in one spot. The weather is
spoiled, no more rainbows or showers. The rain
begins to fall again, and shuts out all the light.
The <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>, accompanied by the <i>Ernest
Renan</i>, weighs anchor.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the two cruisers part from
the battleships. When shall we see them again?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
They follow their vague courses in the south,
wandering from roadstead to roadstead, and remaining
in each without doing anything. They
cover fewer miles than the cruisers, but their
existence is perhaps duller. We watch, they wait;
we run risks, they take shelter. Certainly I had
dreamed of another kind of warfare, but I prefer
the campaign of the cruiser to that of the battleship.</p>

<p>Just as troops in the army are transported by
railway to the seat of operations, so the great
ships tow the French submarines to the entrance
of the Adriatic. Their base is in the bay of
Plateali, behind the palisade of the Archipelago.
Between two chases towards Pola and Cattaro,
they assemble around an old battleship, the <i>Marceau</i>,
which serves them as mother ship. The
<i>Marceau</i> collects shipwrecked crews, renews the
commissary, furnishes its tools for repairing the
small engines. Anxious to get away, the sailors
of the submarines work with file and anvil, and
are happy when they shorten the delay by a day,
or an hour.</p>

<p>We go to look for the <i>Gay-Lussac</i>, whose turn
for refitting has arrived. After a night of heavy
seas, the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> clears the narrows
of Dukato. In default of fine weather, she finds
here a little calm. Ithaca, Cephalonia, Santa
Maura, the Echinades, and the splendid mountains
of Epirus are capped with mist; a foaming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
sea rages round their base; brooks cover them
with a silver network. Some strips of fog float
in the channels, cling to the rocks, and tear apart
like carded wool.</p>

<p>A winding channel opens out on the cove of
the submarines and the <i>Marceau</i>. Crouched in
the depths of their den like a nest of strange
animals, they look gray and shiny; a thread of
smoke is rising lazily from the battleship; the
<i>Gay-Lussac</i>, ready to depart, is throwing from
its stacks short black wreaths of smoke. Islands
and rocks form an enclosed frame all about the
waiting <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>. Some rocks are
formed like saws, crafty and dangerous reefs,
scarcely emerging from the water; others suggest
a face left unfinished, where some capricious giant,
after sculpturing the rough outline of a chin, a
nose, or a jaw, has fixed them there forever; certain
ones reveal exquisite curves, which one wants
to caress like the back of a supple cat or the thigh
of a statue.</p>

<p>The <i>Gay-Lussac</i> detaches itself from the group,
and emerges from Plateali. On our after deck a
group of seamen are arranging the towing tackle;
the prow of the submarine halts a few meters
from us, and we make the proper maneuver. We
can distinguish the features of our comrades in
their cramped black garments. Their young
faces, ruddy with a fine color that has been tanned
by the spray, are gravely happy. A few words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
are shouted down to them; brief responses come
back.</p>

<p>“Are you ready?”</p>

<p>“Quite ready.”</p>

<p>“Do you need anything?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all, thank you.”</p>

<p>“We can start?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead!”</p>

<p>The steel cable unrolls in the water, measures
its length, tightens, threshes about like a serpent
fringed with foam, falls back, and the submarine
begins to follow us. Cautiously we increase the
speed to the prescribed rate, and begin the passage
of the straits and channels. We cannot easily
perform evolutions, because the <i>Gay-Lussac</i>, two
hundred meters behind us, would ram us if we
doubled too short.</p>

<p>The destroyer <i>Mousqueton</i> heads the procession,
moving with ease and grace. All muscle
and speed, her pretty body winds through the
islands, the guardian angel of our present cruise.</p>

<p>Towards evening we come out on the high seas.
The bad weather has not become permanent, but
the crossing will be unpleasant because of the
short choppy swell that comes from Corfu and
Santa Maura. Already the <i>Mousqueton</i> is covered
with showers of spray; the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>
slowly heaves and rolls; at the end of the towing-line,
which vibrates like a rubber band, the <i>Gay-Lussac</i>
bounces in the swell. The dull twilight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
comes on; the clouds descend a little lower, the
wind rises, a gray night follows the slaty evening,
and we begin the crossing which will be twelve
or fourteen hours like so many others.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night I take the watch and
look for my two comrades. If I did not know
that they were there, I should have difficulty in
finding them. An indistinct spot in front of the
prow seems to keep us company; it is the <i>Mousqeton</i>.
She rises and falls like a dripping black
cloth which a laundress shakes incessantly. She
lurches ceaselessly right and left, without finding
any support, and reflects restless gleams in
the night. Thanks to this dark artificial fire, I
do not lose track of her.</p>

<p>The <i>Gay-Lussac</i> is following us back there
among the hills of water. The sentries on our
cruiser, on the side of the towing-line, can tell
by touch whether it remains taut; as long as the
cable is tight, the submarine has not left us; nothing
except its sudden slackness could warn us of
a break of the line. Several times I go down to
the after deck, unable to tell with my eyes whether
the <i>Gay-Lussac</i> is there or not, but the tension
of the cable reassures me.</p>

<p>Towards dawn Fano rises on the horizon, and
near six we prepare to cast off the submarine.
Our engines slow down; we haul in the cable. The
officers have interrupted their sleep, and Mgr.
Bolo, always curious about the sights at sea, leans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
on the rail for the last maneuver. On the submarine
the sailors, like shining tritons, loosen the
tow; its commander raises his arm to indicate that
he is free; his screws make an eddy in the water,
he turns its head to the north, and the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>
turns to the west. The Albanian mountains
watch over this silent parting. How small
the submarine looks, swept by the ceaseless
waves! How weak it seems as it goes to risk
its life in the vast ambushes of the Adriatic! And
how melancholy is this silent departure, without
a handshake, in the rainy and sullen dawn! From
the height of our great ship we feel our hearts
tighten. It is much like seeing a little child cross
alone a square where automobiles are passing, one
wants to say: “Don’t go any farther. Come back
on the sidewalk.” And at the same time one
approves its boldness, and encourages it from the
depths of one’s heart, without even thinking of
the danger. The sailors of the submarine no
longer look at us. Their eyes scan the sea, at
the end of which they are to fulfil their duty.
One desire alone fills their souls; to play their
part well and not to weaken. They are not angels.
The life of each one of them undoubtedly contains
many faults, and I would not swear, that
when they are turned loose on shore, they do not
give way to every intemperance. But at this
moment those ugly things no longer exist. However
gross in their failings, sailors are noble in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
their deeds. At the instant that the <i>Gay-Lussac</i>
passes behind us, the officers raise their caps, and
the priest, without a word, extends his right hand,
blesses and absolves these gallant men.</p>

<p>They go back up the path which the <i>Curie</i>
traversed. They go to hold the sentry-post of
honor before the enemy coasts, and none can foretell
their fate of glory or death. Like their
brothers they seek in the Dalmatian Isles before
Cattaro some ship worth sinking. But probably
the Austrian spies have not failed to follow our
cruise, and the <i>Gay-Lussac</i> will find nothing. For
three or four days, to the limit of its breath and
its electric power, it will prowl invisible. Through
the lenses of the periscope its commander will
see the aviators describing great circles in search
of it; he will make out the onset of the destroyers,
will hide himself in the depths of the sea, and
will hear the passage of the screws above him,
frantic but impotent.</p>

<p class="right"><i>20 January.</i></p>

<p>One evening, out of breath, aching in body and
soul, he will descend the Adriatic, the Ionian Sea,
the Archipelago, to the harbor where not even
repose will be his reward. The entire “naval
army” when it hears the news will breathe more
lightly at the wireless which announces: “The <i>Gay-Lussac</i>
is returned.” And will share in its discomfiture
at the postscript: “It has seen nothing.” It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
will hardly have left the shores of Austria when
the ships will begin to move more freely, until the
coming of the next one. Such is the Odyssey of
the submarines of Plateali. Good luck, <i>Gay-Lussac</i>!</p>

<p class="right"><i>22 January.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> has left the Albanian
waters and reached its cruising sector. The Ionian
Sea is divided into rectangles of vast extent, each
one of which represents the territory of a cruiser.
There she patrols for several days, reaches the
next sector, and so on until she comes near land.
Then she coals in all possible haste, goes to the
farthest rectangle and begins all over again. Our
post for the day is far in the west near the strait
of Messina, at the end of the Italian boot, and
we do not reach it before twilight. We take a
route outside the cruising zones.</p>

<p>Two masts and four smokestacks rise on the
horizon like a play of shadows. It is the <i>Gambetta</i>
prowling about. She sights us, approaches
swiftly, assures herself that we are friends, turns
back and disappears. For several hours we see
nothing but the surge of water and the clouds of
shifting slate. And then the <i>Michelet</i> looms up
in her turn, having just recognized us. We profit
by this proximity to perform a telemetric exercise.
In the course of this exercise the two
cruisers execute a hundred movements which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
bring them together, and separate them, by anywhere
from five to fifteen thousand meters; the
gunners at their places, the telemetrists at the
measuring apparatus, at the proper moment note
the distances. Ships which meet by chance do
not fail to indulge in this practice. A signal rises
to mark the end of the exercise.</p>

<p>The <i>Michelet</i> returns to its patrol, and we push
towards the west. By evening a great wall bars
our horizon. Later a light gleams out with a
pale track across the water. The lighthouse is
called Rizzutto, and shines at the base of the
Calabrian mountains. If the weather were more
favorable we could see the summit of Etna in
a clear atmosphere. Its beautiful outline would
make us forget the proud heights of Albania, in
front of which, this morning, we parted from the
<i>Gay-Lussac</i>. But the sailor must be satisfied with
a gloomy evening and a sullen sea; his only friend
at night will be the light of Rizzutto, which we
shall lose and find again as we move towards the
offing or towards the coast. We have another
companion in the wind, which whistles itself out
of breath, perhaps for fear we should think it
asleep.</p>

<p>Early in the night, as the cruiser nears
Calabria, a sort of luminous halo plays over the
land. We recognize the aureole of a town. Over
there, human beings are at rest, or amusing themselves,
or talking pleasantly before sleeping.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
Here, dressed in leather and rubber, the sailors
struggle with the gale and defy shadows in which
danger may lurk. This contrast haunts the minds
of the lookouts. Are they happy in their sentry duty
in the rain? Do they envy the Italians
sheltered in their peaceful homes? The two ideas
alternate, and in order the better to curse the
Calabrians who are giving them not so much as
a thought, the sailors look for the name of this
troublesome town on the map.</p>

<p>It is called Crotona. In the days when Rome
was weak and Athens powerful, she waged repeated
and bitter war against her rival Sybaris.
Softened by too much luxury, the Sybarites could
not defend themselves against their powerful
enemies, and Crotona, after effacing her voluptuous
enemy from the world, survived throughout
the centuries to show the light of her lamps this
night to some passing French sailors.</p>

<p>Have we not a right, we officers, companions
of the darkness, guardians of a crew of gallant
men—have we not the right to send our dreams
across the war to the regions of antiquity? The
carefree Sybarites left a name which serves only
for jesting. The map is almost ignorant of the
exact places where they ignominiously disappeared,
and the pick of the excavator exhumes
only chalky debris. The people of Crotona bequeathed
the future to proud descendants, because
the sweetness of life did not make them disdain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
war. A stern lesson which we repeat in the biting
north wind and the rolling waves; a parallel
which forces itself upon one in these hours when
France gathers herself together against the barbarians.
But I have no doubts about her. The
men of the <i>Gay-Lussac</i> who went this morning
towards Cattaro, the men of the <i>Curie</i>, who were
stopped by the glorious net at Pola, the men of
the “naval army” who since August have lived
in company with hardship, the men who freeze
in the trenches of Artois and the Vosges, the
men who have fallen on the plains of Flanders
and Champagne—these men will not play before
posterity the rôle of Sybarites.</p>

<p class="right"><i>25 February.</i></p>

<p>Like feudal barons, who lance in hand ride over
their empty manors ruined by war, the cruisers
traverse a lifeless waste. During the slow succession
of days, they are glad to sight, by chance,
the stacks of their companions of the patrol. As
she comes to the boundaries of her rectangle, the
sister ship seems to give us a nod and a good-day.
Suddenly our world is alive again. Our
thoughts are directed toward our neighbor, and
her’s toward us. Whether it is the <i>Renan</i>, the
<i>Quinet</i>, the <i>Gambetta</i>, or an entirely different one,
we follow her and accompany her movements; the
sailors abandon their work and their reveries for
this reality which wavers before them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“She is approaching!”</p>

<p>“I see her bridge!”</p>

<p>“Look, the forestack is pouring out black
smoke. They are stoking up the fires!”</p>

<p>“Ah! She is coming on the left. Her masts
are passing one after the other.”</p>

<p>“Are we not a good twenty-two thousand meters
away?”</p>

<p>“She is farther away. Do you still see her
masts?”</p>

<p>“Yes! No! Yes! No! No more.”</p>

<p>The cruiser vanishes and our world becomes
empty again. This lasts a day or a week. Sometimes
between two clearings of the weather some
darker spot appears in the distance, cloud or
mountain, cliff or play of the clearing storm, no
one can say. But the mechanics and the stokers,
the hidden hosts of the depths, who come on deck
between two watches ask curiously in the
darkness:</p>

<p>“What do we see over there?”</p>

<p>The gunners and seamen, with a grand manner,
repeat the scraps of officers’ talk they have overheard
and remembered. They announce the
oracle: “It is Epirus;” “it is Apulia;” “it is
the Peloponnesus;” “it is Albania;” “it is
Etna;” “it is nothing at all; we are a hundred
miles from land.” The baffled men store up these
complicated names, and in the next letter to their
fathers or to some women in the country, each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
will write them down painfully; the strange words
will carry to French cottages the echo of our
geographical Odyssey. I should like to know the
impressions made by these sonorous names, full
of dignity, but without meaning to the ignorant.
What do our brave sailors see in this fresco of
coasts which we never approach? They are like
the imaginary forms created in sleep; wavering,
rising, disappearing on the borders of the horizon,
they pass like Edens where we shall never land.
The cruiser goes and comes on its rectangle of
water, and while the officers strive to guess the
meaning of this formless nothingness that emerges
from the rain, the sailors pursue their dreams,
the rain falls or is blown away in the caprices of
the gale.</p>

<p>Yes, we pay to the hilt the ransoms for our
patrolling! Nothing moves on the sea any more
that carries an enemy flag. Nothing suspect approaches
us. Masters of the seas, we have made
it a desert for those who do not work for our
side. If I dared, I should say that we have done
our task too well, for everything which our country
gains through our vigilance, we lose in boredom.
The days of visits and searches is over;
even these small distractions have fled from our
daily labors. If there are contrabandists, they
stick like woodlice to neutral shores, and carry
to Austria or Turkey, at the price of increasing
risks, the precious goods which become rarer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
every day. Their detours are long and laborious,
but we cannot harass them so long as they frequent
the territorial waters. Sensitive to their
sovereign rights, Greece and Italy, by the regulations
of war, do not permit us to approach their
coasts; we are condemned to remain in the offing
which our persistent surveillance has devastated.
Doubtless Austrian submarines are moving under
the waves. The hour for one of us will perhaps
strike. Woe to the ship that becomes careless
through lassitude!</p>

<p>But at least, on the great routes from Gibraltar
to Suez or Saloniki the English and French transports
are sailing without impediment. Formerly
their fleet moved westward carrying to Marseilles
or the Atlantic ports the men and products of
the East. But for several weeks, since the entry
of the Turks into the war, a second route has
been established and is more frequented every
day. Bases of operations are being installed in
the Ægean Sea, in the Greek Islands; naval forces
are assembling there; a few detached cruisers
watch the coasts of Syria and Asia Minor; and
multitudes of active troops are congregating down
there.</p>

<p class="right"><i>2 February.</i></p>

<p>All these movements go on in silence, the silence
that is the proper preparation for enterprises of
war. The world does not yet suspect what is
going on; its ears have not heard those names<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
which, unknown to-day, will before long become
famous. But the sailors pursue the task, and
their souls quiver with joyous anticipation of these
military glories in the East.</p>

<p>Sometimes, from a cloud charged with lightning,
there is slowly detached a massive shred,
that one can scarcely distinguish as it glides upward
to some clear portion of the sky. The cloud
swells, extends and forms into a new storm which
rages, far away from the clouds which engendered
it. Thus, born from the European War, a new
war is in secret ferment; before the thunderbolts
fall on the lands of Islam, we are preparing them
in the mysterious and silent seas. We are acquainted
with the daily effort, the cautious approach
of the Allies, the legions of gallant men
who caress their guns during the long Mediterranean
crossing. But we take no pride in this
knowledge. We expect to go on protecting the
march of the soldiers towards glory. And we
hope for the supreme joy of sharing their risks,
hand in hand, so to speak, they on land, and we
on the restless element of the sea.</p>

<p>At present the seventh week of our pilgrimage
is closing in hail and frost. Since our trip to
Malta, before Christmas, we have experienced all
the evil moods of the weather, which grows angrier
and angrier. At night, one falls and hurts
oneself on the sleet-covered steel decks, as on a
hard mirror invisible and yet in motion.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span><i>5 February.</i></p>

<p>Like seed thrown by some terrible hand, the
hailstones bounce on the cruiser, which rings like
a tambourine; and the sea, whipped up by these
projectiles from the sky, makes a noise like a
boiling liquid. The organ of the winds harasses
our watches. Dismal and raucous, they stride
breathlessly over the miles of water; their rage
vents itself on the ship, and on our bodies, in
icy handfuls of spray; when they strike against
the cordage and metallic structures, they whistle
and sing like evil geniuses filled with mirth. We
know the harmony of each cord, of each halyard,
of each cable, as they vibrate above our heads.
Whether short or long, thick or thin, made of
hemp or twisted steel, they have their share in
the tireless orchestra. Certain ones give out in
the north wind a clear and joyous sound, like a
fife, bagpipe or flute. Others, melancholy strains
like cellos and oboes, reminding one of the bells
of one’s native village, of beloved distant voices,
of all the sweetness of France to one forlorn in
nights of exile. But the hollow, tolling notes that
are thrown from the heavy, wet cordage, sound
a perpetual knell that is heard above everything.
If one stops one’s ears, their sinister bass penetrates
one’s fingers and head. They are always
there. They are triumphant. To the cold of the
body they add the chill of the soul.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span><i>6 February.</i></p>

<p>Montenegro is dying of hunger. From the top
of its barren mountains its people can see the
Adriatic, and imagine the prosperous lands in
the distance, Africa and Italy and their crops.
Towards these bountiful harvests they stretch
their appeals and their greedy hands; but famine,
following war, is devastating their homes.</p>

<p>Despite her own agony, France does not suspect
into what horrors the present tragedy can
plunge the peoples who are cut off from the world.
In Paris and in the provinces there is food, and
subsistence. Whatever the price, meat and bread
can be bought at the butcher’s and baker’s.
Montenegro has nothing. Walled up in a dungeon,
its women and its soldiers scatter to the four
winds appeals which do not feed them.</p>

<p>From the north, Austria is waging against it
that same campaign of devastation which she began
against the Serbs. To the south, Albania,
that courtesan of pillage; only waits the command
to throw her bands into Cettinje. To the East,
Serbia, hemmed in, remains alive only by a tenacity
which will amaze the future. And, finally,
towards the West, the sea, closed to the nations
without navies, leaves deserted the harbors of
Montenegro, and empties her granaries.</p>

<p>In spite of that, she does not hesitate. At the
first insults hurled against her by her Slavic
cousins, each man took his cartridges, wound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
around his legs the puttees of war, and went to
the frontiers to fight in defense of honor. If I
had not forbidden myself to inscribe here events
which have nothing to do with the Navy, I should
tell of this drama of skirmishes, raids, night
assassinations, in which a handful of mountaineers,
without arsenals or foundries or commissary
supplies, or routes or guns, renews every
week, against the immense armies of Austria, the
exploits of Leonidas against Xerxes.</p>

<p>But this perseverance, invincible to the attacks
of men, has to yield to the sufferings of the body.
To conserve energy in his muscles, precision in
his eyes, firmness in his will, the Montenegrin
has to have food. They call for help. Since snow
and mud have taken possession of their kingdom,
Prince Nicholas and his ministers send out wireless
messages of supplication. Smothering their
invincible pride and the shame of yielding to
hunger, they tell us every day the story of their
distress. Just now, in some district that had been
bombarded by heavy artillery, the storehouses
were burned, and the meager provisions of a year
destroyed. Another day, Croatians and Bosnians,
pursued by the Austrian butchers, took refuge in
ruined Montenegro; as gifts they brought only
their hate and their hunger.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this little agrarian population
opened their arms, and for these people without
a country they deprived themselves of a pinch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
wheat from their own pittance. Our wireless
poles receive a new story of distress every moment;
the children are dying, the soldiers have
no more shoes, the cartridge boxes are empty,
and the mules are dying along the roads where
they find nothing to eat but snow.</p>

<p>Who will feed these unfortunates unless it be
generous France? For months the “naval army”
has supplied Montenegro. In the Ionian Sea
cargo-boats come to get orders from the Commander-in-Chief,
and then go to the ports of
Antivari or Medua. They bring wheat, corn,
equipment, munitions, and empty them in haste
on the wharves, fearful of these dangerous waters.</p>

<p>These are enterprises for contrabandists and
pirates. The Austrians know our least movement,
spy upon the arrival of our cargo-boat; and
their submarines, and aviators, and destroyers,
make any unloading by day impossible. Everything
has to be done at night, between the setting
and the rising of one sun.</p>

<p>Far from the coasts a squadron ascends the
Adriatic. It is composed of a precious battleship,
some destroyers and large cruisers. We keep a
careful lookout, for the enemy lies in wait. At
the fall of evening, the squadron arrives off port;
the cargo-boat and the destroyers turn aside; the
cruisers push farther north towards the approaches
of Cattaro, in order to prevent the first
attack. At a little distance from the roadstead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
where they unload, a line of destroyers cruises
about all night, ready to repulse any sudden attacks.
In the harbor itself are anchored one or
two other destroyers, motionless sentinels of the
affair. The cargo-boat approaches the wharf.</p>

<p>There is nothing to be seen. The rain, wind
and hail fall in avalanches from the icy heights.
We must not show a light. Montenegrin soldiers
try to offer their assistance, but they know little
about delicate maneuvering, and in the darkness
they get in the way. Somehow or other the commander
of the cargo-boat manages to get it alongside
the wooden jetty; he strikes it, tears his hull,
breaks the hawser, swears and storms. The
sailors of the destroyers come to help; they find
their way to the wharf in small boats. With agile
fingers and feet they grip the uprights, take hold
of the cables and gropingly make them fast. The
boat clings tight to the quay, and immediately a
stream of sacks, cases and bales pours out. The
Montenegrin soldiers come up, seize the black
things in the darkness, drag them up the bank,
run, stumble, fall. One must work quickly and
keep silent. Up above, the camps and the huts
are waiting.</p>

<p>But a noise in the air makes us prick up our
ears. It comes from the north, a droning which
is louder than the wind. It grows, and intrudes
itself into the darkness like a sonorous wail. Another
sound, duller, from farther off, accompanies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
it and draws near. Others follow, like dark wasps.
These are the aviators from Cattaro. The sound
of their flight rolls in the air above the harbor,
diminishes and descends, makes a circle about the
wharf, diminishes and descends again, directly
above the cargo-boat. The target is indicated by
the heavy sound of the bales and the hurried steps.
A shower of bombs falls.</p>

<p>It is impossible to respond. The Montenegrin
coast is not organized against aviators. The projectors
that one could light on board would only
draw the shots with greater precision; the crews,
handicapped, occupied with the unloading, cannot
fire guns or cannon. On the wharf, in the water,
on the deck of the boat, the bombs burst, setting
fire to the woodwork and the cases, mixing with
the storm a suffocating smoke. Terrified by this
unaccustomed enemy, the Montenegrin soldiers
grow slack; the sailors, however, pursue their
perilous task humming a song.</p>

<p>Sometimes a shell falls into the hold which is
being emptied. If it bursts, some men are mowed
down; if it rests harmlessly on the piles of sacks,
hands seek it in the dark, seize it, throw it into
the water, and the work continues. Exhausted by
past watches, the crews work through this night
without losing a second, and find means to stow
neatly the sacks which will be of no use to them.
No matter which destroyers and cargo-boats take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
part, the same business goes on at the wharves of
Antivari and Medua every three or four nights.</p>

<p>While this is going on, the destroyers maintain
a defense at the opening of the bays. The hearts
of the men are anxious when they hear the fall
and see the bursting of the bombs over their toiling
friends. But their own turn is not long delayed.
Before returning to Cattaro the airmen
do not hesitate to drop their visiting cards on
the sentinel squadron. But for fear of betraying
their position, the latter do not reply. At their
post on the sea, wiping the spray from their faces,
the sailors hear the descent of the bombs, screaming
in the north wind, and keep their spirits
equally high whether the shells touch or miss the
mark.</p>

<p class="right"><i>8 February.</i></p>

<p>Further out, further north, the cruisers scout
between Cattaro and the menaced harbors. Towards
the end of one of their Ionian cruises, the
Commander-in-Chief designates them in succession
for this work; they do not care for these
expeditions in which there are blows to receive,
but none to give.</p>

<p>For from beginning to end of these voyages to
succor Montenegro danger is present. Every
time the cruisers ascend the Adriatic, they meet
with mines set loose by the Austrians, which trail
adrift, like evil beasts too lazy to run after their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
prey. On our last cruise the <i>Waldeck</i> and her
comrade saw several, though the brown speck is
scarcely distinguishable upon the blue carpet of
the waves. We approached them at a respectful
distance, for fear they might be bound together
like beads, and that other mines, invisible, would
hit us as we passed. We demolished them with
gunfire, without halting; they burst and sank,
throwing off an inoffensive sheaf of yellow smoke.
But what will happen to the ship that strikes one
of them in the thick of the darkness, where one
sees nothing?</p>

<p>And then, as the cruisers do every time, we
watched all night the approaches of Cattaro,
ready to receive the submarines and destroyers
which will not fail sooner or later to attack the
supply-boats at Antivari or Medua. In the misty,
rainy atmosphere the searchlights of the Austrian
harbor flash and sweep the sea, searching for the
enemy they suspect to be within range. These
great white restless eyes wander ceaselessly to
right and left, and halt sometimes upon us. But
the cruisers are so far away, shrouded in rain,
that the enemy confuses them with the sheets of
rain that are falling. Behind their guns, lighted
up like specters, our gunners hold themselves
ready to reply to the fire of the batteries if they
begin. But nothing happens except a silent waiting;
the searchlights abandon our vague outline,
and go on indefinitely sweeping space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>From hour to hour our anxious wireless asks
news of the unloading. And the destroyer
anchored near the cargo-boat answers in short
phrases:</p>

<p>“Rain and hail. Half done.”</p>

<p>Or else:</p>

<p>“Very bad weather. We do not expect to be
through before six in the morning.”</p>

<p>As night wears away, thanks to the tension of
mind and the bad weather, disquietude increases
on the cruisers. They would like to be nearer,
sharing the danger of the others. They fear some
catastrophe before dawn.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The other night we saw some suspicious lights
in that direction; short sparks like will-o’-the-wisps
which succeeded in traversing the leagues of
rainy air. The officers on the watch stood by
helpless at these signs of the drama that must
be going on. Soon the wireless despatch arrived,
and was feverishly translated by the ensign on
duty.</p>

<p>“The airmen are bombarding us. The bombs
are exploding on deck. One fell into the hold. All
the Montenegrins have fled and taken shelter on
the shore. We fear we shall not be able to finish
at dawn. The Austrians continue the bombardment.”</p>

<p>Immediately the <i>Waldeck</i> replied:</p>

<p>“If there is too much danger, or you are no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
longer numerous enough, stop the unloading, leave
the harbor; we are coming to your assistance.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for a response, we made for
the bombarded harbor, moving at top speed,
for fear we should arrive too late. But in less
than ten minutes our rush was stopped short by
the wireless reply, which showed their astonishment
at our proposition.</p>

<p>“We will continue alone. We will not leave
until daybreak. There is almost nothing left to
unload.”</p>

<p>They did as they said! They did even better.
How did they find means to increase their
strength, to make up for the flight of the Montenegrins?
They did not even think they had done
a big thing, but at dawn the holds were empty,
and on the wharf were heaped to the last one the
bales that had been in their charge. Ah! the brave
sailors!</p>

<p class="right"><i>9 February.</i></p>

<p>Long hours flow away. The January nights
seem eternal when one has to live them wide
awake. But at last the sky pales in the East,
the lights of Cattaro sink into the grayness and
a sharper cold revives the watchers a little. It
is dawn.</p>

<p>Empty or not, the cargo-boat casts off its
hawsers, and as clumsily as it entered the night
before, it leaves in the morning. On the wharf<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
are heaped the supplies for Montenegro; more
will be brought in a few days. The stevedores
go back to the destroyers, and exchange their
night’s fatigue for that of the engines and the
work of navigating the ship. The procession
forms again in the mist, and goes down the coast
of Albania in good shape. Without ballast, the
cargo-boat dances in the midst of the convoys like
a cork. At a great distance the cruisers continue
their proud vigil until all this little company is
out of harm’s way. Then they feed their fires,
stretch their legs, and limber up with a little gallop
as far as their Ionian sectors.</p>

<p>Or else between sunrise and twilight, they coal
in some hidden bay. And if chance favors them,
they receive letters, and bundles of papers which
have wandered in pursuit of them over the vast
sea. Although it has left France so many weeks
ago, and is already old, and made stale by events,
the news is read and commented upon with
passion.</p>

<p>The sailors are not turned aside from the great
drama by any mediocre or banal concerns. Among
all the people of the world, it is they who vibrate
most strongly to all the joys and troubles of
France. Their clear vision, free from passion,
judges calmly the conflict of the two parties.
Better than anyone, thanks to the patience of their
pilgrimages, they discern in the future the reasons
for victory and the heavy ordeal of attaining it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>Bent on their secret task, they do not heed the
dazzlement of victories. They know that their
collaboration, decisive as it is, will be effaced by
the future prowess of the soldiers. The gunfire,
the charges, the final drama for which the land
will be the theater, will relegate their silent labor
to oblivion. But to overthrow Germany both will
be needed, and the glorious army can hold out a
grateful hand to the Navy.</p>

<p>Already our fleets are closing the doors of the
world upon our enemies, and keeping them wide
open for the resources that will feed our victory.
As yet it is nothing; but hour by hour we forge
a new lock. When Germany and her allies, foaming
with rage in the prison to which our ships
are the bars, suffer the tortures of famine; when
the one hundred and ten millions of Germans,
howling at death’s door, demand pity, and beg a
bit of bread, when this menagerie tears itself to
pieces in the struggle for food; when revolt, insurrection,
and the frenzy of civil war shake to
its foundations this manufactory of murder; then,
Russia, England and France will let loose their
bulldogs and their tamers. From their bridges
the marines will hear the footsteps of the soldiers’
charge and the barkings of their 75’s. Their
hearts will leap with joy, and, gazing at the sea,
the companion of evil days and luminous sunrises,
they will say to her: “It is we two together who
have made it possible for all this to happen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>Why does my vision wander to those happy
days, our recompense? Is it because of the contrasting
melancholy of winter? Or else, have I
not been conducted thither by a natural path,
through the letters of comrades, the illustrious
marine fusiliers in Belgium? Since their wounds
have got better through hospital treatment and
convalescence, they have commenced writing
again. Nearly all my friends over there are dead.
Those who remain describe in simple language the
trip to Antwerp, the return in the horror of the
conflict, the resistance so savage that our enemies
will never acknowledge that it was this handful
of brave men who blocked their rush. History
will reward these officers, these sailor-soldiers
whom we knew on the deck of the men-of-war.
Where they have been, we should all like to have
fought. The entire “naval army” is jealous of
this naval brigade. Exiled from the sea, they
were acquainted with the cyclones of the struggle.
Separated from the hurricanes at sea, they did
not lower their heads before the mysterious
thunderstorms of the Yser and Flanders. They
paid the price of their courage in a terrific hecatomb;
the barrier where the German invasion was
stopped is built on blue collars and red pompons.</p>

<p>We shall never see again those naive faces
which laughed at the tempest. Their death was
not such as they would have chosen; they have
had to pass to their eternal rest beside the bank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
of a canal or a marsh, with their hands tightened
on their guns and a last smile fluttering on their
eyelids. When their brains reeled with the dizzy
agony, and their torn limbs were trembling, they
could imagine themselves in the grip of the sea’s
great surges, and glimpses of its vastness floated
through their last visions. Under the gray skies
of the Belgian plains, their glazed eyes saw the
skies of typhoons; the mud in which they sank
took for the moment the odor of their native
spray; in delirium their ears recognized in the
noise of the shells the blows of the waves on the
hull; in the whistling of the balls the sound of
the wind as it makes the cordage vibrate as if
under violin-bows. All this drowns out the usual
memories that accompany one’s last hours—the
chiming of village bells, the murmurs of a sweetheart
or old grandmother. For there are two
things in the world which a man never forgets—the
fascination of the sea, and the tenderness of
women. But when the soldier approaches the
threshold of eternity, the phantoms of the latter
disappear before the last appeal of the former.</p>

<p>All these things I read in the narrative of the
survivors. They remember the lightning storm
which preceded this emptiness from which they
have come back. Unaccustomed to the march, they
could not think of the sea during those atrocious
days when at each step their feet and their knees
became heavier with a weight that fairly nailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
them to the ground. But they went on just the
same. They did not think of the sea when their
breaking lines recoiled before the German flood.
Neither could they think of it under the storms
of shells. But at the minute when they wavered
between life and that which has no name, they
all received the final kiss of the sea. Its whispers
cradled them, and they were grieved that they
could not be buried in its watery grave. Thinking
of their comrades, they bequeathed to them the
hope of perishing in its enveloping arms, during
some heroic combat.</p>

<p>From their hospitals and homes the survivors
send us their good wishes. Towards the East,
towards the Dardanelles, the world is beginning
to direct its attention, and the ships at last are
going to experience a great conflict. Our sailors
have received the heritage from the marine
fusiliers. They envied, they are envied; thus runs
the world. If fate destines them to write history
with their blood, and no longer merely with their
patience, their desire claims the legacy from their
brothers who have fallen over there.</p>

<p class="right"><i>End of February.</i></p>

<p>In one of our trips to carry supplies to Montenegro,
the <i>Dague</i> has just been lost. In the
open roadstead, at midnight, she was waiting for
the cargo-boat to finish unloading its bales and
cases on the wharf. Her crew was assisting in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
this dangerous work. The heavy sound of the
cases falling on the planks was all that could be
heard.... But a submarine from Austria was
lying in wait for the <i>Dague</i>.</p>

<p>Suddenly the destroyer leaped into the air as
if lifted by the hand of a giant. It fell in two
pieces like a dead branch of wood. The sailors,
enclosed in her sides, did not know they were at
the point of death. Thirty seconds later, at the
spot where there had been a living ship, and men
full of energy, there was no longer anything but
the dark water.</p>

<p class="right"><i>1 March.</i></p>

<p>Malta at last! Landscapes which do not move,
roads of hard stone, a desired presence....
Some drives in an English dog-cart behind a
frisky pony.... A dress of mauve muslin, the
sweet Italian tongue interrupted by silences, the
charming visits to the fountain of the swans.</p>

<p>Malta, remote island and jewel of the Mediterranean,
blessed repose of navigators, peaceful
harbor and immense fortifications, feverish
atmosphere and nostalgia of the blue sky. All
the roads cross there. Between the antipodes
and the fields of battle the Hindu, the Canadians
and the French pass several hours there; and
later, in the night watches, each one will remember
his happy rest in that place.</p>

<p>Malta, the starting point for the warriors of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Egypt, of the Dardanelles, of Mesopotamia, and
Flanders; the port of call for the sailors of the
Mediterranean, of the North Sea and the Persian
Gulf. In the Strada Reale clash faces, uniforms,
dialects; they linger on the mystical pavements
of the churches, and pass into the rocky countryside
to dream those dreams one never forgets.</p>

<p>Malta: First pilgrimage of the new crusade.
The battleships and cruisers, the drag-nets and
dredgers get their second wind here before sailing
for the East, for Constantinople. They go there
to take part in epic conflicts, and retake from the
Osmanlis the city of the Bosphorus, which for five
hundred years has awaited its deliverance. Regiments,
batteries and squads accompany them,
crowded on the transports and eager for victory.
May the men who are preparing this great enterprise,
this terrible enterprise, measure well its
obstacles, and be able to obviate them!</p>

<p>Malta, paradise of the vagabond weary of
wandering, light fragrances, exquisite light, enchanting
sea, creator of tenderness. Oh, these
evenings and mornings when the heart melts in
one’s breast! But one needs a companion. Woe
to the lonely man! He will not appreciate the
smiles of this Eden. He cannot enjoy its treasures.
How many sailors’ wives, who have come here to
see for a moment the husbands torn from them
seven months ago, will not remember this idyllic
spot with tears in their eyes? But other loves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
are born on this island, which perhaps will die
there. These amours I desire every man to have
who fights on land or sea. Then a shell will but
bring him happiness.</p>

<p>Farewell, Malta! Yesterday under a fragrant
arbor the evening light shone on a tragic face,
and the coming separation made our speech falter.
This morning, towards dawn, in a silent church,
two clasped hands and a bowed head were praying
for the safety of the traveler. The <i>Waldeck</i>
left during the day. It took its way slowly among
the motionless ships, which will soon sail in their
turn. Outside of the harbor, already moving with
the swell, it put on full speed and raced over the
blue water. Along the ramparts some handkerchiefs
and soft hands waved sad farewells. Every
one of us, with his glass to his eyes, looked for
the beloved face and dress, which were becoming
fainter with every turn of the ship’s screws. And
then distance wiped everything out. Over there
lovely eyes have been weeping; here our lids are
still wet. The sailor’s malady—what is it but
separation?</p>

<p class="right"><i>Ionian Sea, 5 March.</i></p>

<p>The Spring is venturing her first caresses. I
know countrysides in France where the cherry
trees are already blooming, where violets are
fragrant, and lilacs are beginning to unfold. The
April sun will soon set flowing the tide of life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
and bloom; the poppies will get their color from
the blood spilled in Champagne and the Vosges.</p>

<p>But upon our sterile sea no grass grows green,
no tree blossoms. The water is bluer and the
sky paler, the air brings softer breaths, but these
beauties are mere phantoms. They glide past
like the moments of our monotonous life, like the
white clouds filled with light which move above us.</p>

<p>A few living things distract our melancholy.
Young porpoises, with silver bellies and slender
snouts, play around the hull, lashing the water
as if with thongs of whipcord, falling back with
a gleaming graceful movement. The old porpoises,
mere dignified, follow patiently their continual
leapings, sewing the cloth of the sea with an
invisible thread; each one of their stitches on this
blue material leaves a streak of foam.</p>

<p>When these playful fish pass at a short distance
from us, they are amusing. But what frights
their more distant tracks through the water have
given the officers of the watch! On an empty and
shining sea, the silver trail of a porpoise looks
too much like the volute of a periscope.... And
the periscopes are prowling about.... The fine
days have arrived, and the sea is favorable for
submarines to come down the Adriatic as far as
the Ionian Sea. Many people may not think so,
but the cruisers know that the enemy is hunting
them to the death. We meet on the water vast
flat mirror-like tracks like the trail of a snail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
on the ground. A submarine has just passed.
From one end of the horizon to the other the
viscous line is sparkling, but the horizon is empty.</p>

<p class="right"><i>9 March.</i></p>

<p>Several times at twilight one of the cruisers
has seen rising, far away, the kiosk and shell of
a submarine, coming to the surface for the night.
The cruiser has rushed upon the enemy, but in
the splendid evening this fish of steel has filled
its reservoirs again and quietly submerged. The
red of the sky gives place to purple, and the purple
to violet, and the violet to black, to darkness. The
cruiser in pursuit has informed the “naval army”
of the encounter. We know she is not mistaken,
but the other ships, patrolling in the south, treat
us as visionaries.</p>

<p>Visionaries indeed! If only we were! We
should not then experience, during our watch,
these sudden heart failures, and the nights of the
watch would not be riddled with these useless
agonies. Each day the crews become more apprehensive
of some fatal surprise, and no one is
indifferent on board except the animals who dwell
with us. Happy beasts! Nature has freed them
from forebodings.</p>

<p>Our cats, lazy and coquettish, choose a couch on
the warm deck in the sun, and roll themselves up
in a ball, with their nose resting on their furry
paws, their green eyes half closed; or else they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
stretch out on their sides, stiffening and unbending
their paws, and letting the breeze play on
their bodies. They forget to sleep. Under the
moon or in the darkness they go sidewise, slowly
brushing the cordage and the rasping metal.
Sometimes they mew with a call that is soft,
raucous, and hopeless, for ships of war are chaste,
and our poor tomcats spend their nights without
any spring amours.</p>

<p>Towards four o’clock in the morning Venus
rises fresh and dazzling. Soon the feathery tribe
begins to stir. Between the chimneys a cock proclaims
his fanfare, the hens cackle, and great disputes,
accompanied by much rustling of wings,
take place over a cabbage leaf or some water or
a grain of corn. Our pigeons coo softly, as they
puff their necks; their glossy wings powdered
with salt dew. Breaking in on these light sounds
comes the lament of the oxen which are to be
slaughtered. They low discreetly. At this din,
which reminds one of one’s native land and one’s
country home, the officer of the watch on the
bridge thinks he smells the odor of the poultry-yard,
the healthy odor of dung, and listens to the
creaking of the carts as they leave the farm. It
is the illusion of homesickness. The only voices
of labor are the humming of the ventilators, the
pulsation of the engines, and the vibration of the
waves which slap the hull. Our only ties with the
world are the cruisers, with their stacks and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
remote smoke, which go from sector to sector on
the same careful vagabondage. And we have no
other reason for living than to await the prowling
submarines. The submarines, the curse of this
war!</p>

<p class="right"><i>11 March.</i></p>

<p>There is one formidable problem which I have
not yet solved.</p>

<p>From the bridge the officer sees a companion
vessel explode, sink and disappear. The catastrophe
may be slow or swift, it matters not. Many
men have just been killed by the explosion; but
there remain living survivors in the water, who
are condemned to death if their neighbors do not
come up to rescue them. The officer’s pitiful heart
directs him to rush towards the disaster and pick
up these brothers of ours.</p>

<p>But no! The submarine is perhaps waiting and
is aiming a new torpedo. It is lying in wait for
the rescuer with her formidable strength, her
thousand able men, and is counting on her rashness
to send her to join the victim it has just
sunk. The duty of the officer tells him to save
a sound ship for France, so that to-morrow she
may avenge the dead in some victorious action.</p>

<p>The English Admiralty has solved the dilemma.
“Woe to the wounded!” it has said. “I order
the living to flee!”</p>

<p>The men who drew up this formidable law in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
the privacy of their offices were thinking only of
the glory of their navy, of the fate of their country.
Would these same men, as officers of the
watch, hearing the appeal of drowning men, have
the terrible courage to flee?</p>

<p>During the long hours of the watch I have
pondered over this riddle. To-morrow, this evening,
in an instant, the drama of which I am thinking
may rise on the horizon. If fate wills that
I be struck, I know that as my mouth fills with
water, my last cry, to those who approach me
will be this:</p>

<p>“Begone, for the submarine is watching for
you too!”</p>

<p>But if in the treacherous night or under the
kindly sun, I see one of the companion ships of
the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> destroyed, I hope some
inspiration will dictate my conduct. I cannot
foresee what it will be. There are tragedies where
the reason stumbles, and man is outdone by the
malignity of things, where only revelation and
divine grace permit him to find his way.</p>

<p>This is the way weariness bewitches one. If
we were in action, I should never feel these
dilemmas. I should not like to repeat here what
all my comrades every minute and every hour are
saying around me. Never have the cruisers been
plunged into a profounder ennui. The great naval
routes pass north or south of our present beats,
the battleships are at the Peloponnesus, in Crete,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
and we can no longer see the coasts of Italy, our
companions in recent months. We should never
suspect that land existed if wireless messages did
not bring us a suggestion of it.</p>

<p>Whence come these birds which for many days
now have followed our cruiser as it emerged from
the winter? What woods, what nests, have they
left? By day they fly from mast to mast, cat-head
to bridge, and by night they hide in dark
corners.... We are wandering on the treeless
waste, two or three hundred kilometers from any
shore, and yet these birds with their fragile wings
choose our island of steel to rest upon before
continuing their journey. They are very young
birds, and carry themselves badly upon their inexperienced
wings.</p>

<p class="right"><i>14 March.</i></p>

<p>A swallow, a chaffinch, a robin and a bullfinch,
are what I have seen this morning, about sunrise.</p>

<p>In the wide expanse there was the growing
light, a pale moon leaning towards the west, some
idle curls of smoke, and my vague thoughts. And
then, from nowhere, came this chaffinch, and
stopped on the bridge at my feet, looked at me
impertinently, seemed reassured by its examination,
and without further concerning itself with
me, began hopping on the floor. Then the swallow
arrived, restless and swift, but so awkward that,
as it rested on the steel bars, it swayed and caught
itself as if it thought it was falling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>It remains faithful to us. The sailors with their
affectionate and clumsy hands, have already tied
on its dark body a yellow favor which it wears
coquettishly. It is our passenger. The others,
more lively, only pause between two flights; they
peck on our deck, and by chance discover something
to store in their tiny paunches; perched on
a rod, a partition, or the rigging, they rest awhile,
with their heads hunched in their feathers and
their wings up to their eyes like blinkers. We
call them; they do not answer, for they are asleep.
And then all of a sudden the chaffinches and robins
fly away, as if they really knew where they were
going. They trust themselves without fear to the
great mysterious emptiness, and to-morrow other
finches and other robins will come, and will also
fly away. We love them when they are there. We
forget them when they fly away. We shall not
weep for their death. They are like us, mariners
of the air.</p>

<p class="right"><i>15 March.</i></p>

<p>They are happier than we, for they are not
preoccupied with their fate, all the winds that
pass are favorable to their wings. Carelessness
is their daily bread. They never ask the reasons
for their pilgrimages, and do not guess that their
lives might be more useful. We envy their spirit
and their empty heads. How many times have
we not wished to kill our reason and become like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
machines, which work without thinking? The
sailors cannot know this infinite weariness of
anxious thought, and they would never say the
bitter things that rise in our minds from the strain
of overwork. Are there any combatants in this
war who have need of so much patience for so
painful a task? For weeks and months, ever since
the origin of time, it seems, the sailors have been
here performing the same duties, seeing the same
faces, hearing the same voices. They know beforehand
what their neighbor is going to say.
Whether we are paradoxical or bitter, braggart
or fatalistic, each of us has long ago finished
emptying out his intellectual baggage. There is
no chance of evasion or of renewal. One sees the
very inside of hearts. Some solid friendships,
cemented by common miseries, cheer this existence.
But aversions and enmities are strengthened. In
many ward rooms now the meals have become
gloomy or charged with ill-feeling. One has to
keep silent for fear of setting off the evil spark.
Everything provides material for discord, and
nothing inspires amiable thoughts. One does not
wish to make venomous relations that are already
strained, and so one says nothing.</p>

<p>Spasmodically, at the reading of an important
communiqué or wireless messages, discussions
burst forth and wax intense. For the thousandth
time we sift over what has been said, and as all
the arguments were laid on the table eight months<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
ago, no one can win in the encounter unless he
can shout louder than the others. The president
of the mess, cool and benevolent, throws himself
into the fray, and his advice makes us see the
inanity of such disputes. The officers understand
that he is right. Better to keep out of it.</p>

<p>Silence falls again. While awaiting his watch,
the officer returns to his cabin and tries to forget
his troubles. Shall he write to his dear ones?
What for, and what shall he say to them? Everyone
devotes himself to some mechanical task. This
one is learning Spanish, Greek, Japanese; others
are measuring their strength on the Ethics of
Spinoza, or the theory of the equations of partial
derivatives; some are doing carving, collecting
stamps or raising turtles. The essential thing is
to get a man’s mind away from the ship, from
the water, from himself.</p>

<p>The night, solitary, kindly, ends with the dawn.
Sleep effaces everything, and our duty transforms
us into automatons. On the bridge the officer no
longer thinks of anything but his superior duties.
Near him stand watching the accustomed statues
of gunners and steersmen; under him gently
vibrates the moving vessel; and all around stretch
the silent shadows. Above his head wings like
felt open and close, and form rings of sound. They
are the horned owls, migratory birds too, which
have substituted our masts for their native nests.
Frightened, they wheel above the watchers, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
their hairy wings sometimes brush our caps. In
the blackness of the sky, they fly uncertainly
about, hiding the stars and then disclosing them
again. Their flight and their silence are congenial
to our thoughts. For them the sun does not exist,
any more than happiness exists for us. Perhaps
they would like the light, but their blinking eyes
cannot endure it. They are like our own hearts.
For months past we have lost all the joys of life,
and dare no longer look them in the face.</p>

<p class="right"><i>17 March.</i></p>

<p>After four hours of anxious thought and watching,
the officer leaves his successor in charge and
goes down to his cabin or the ward-room. He
is too wide awake to fall quickly asleep, too tired
to think. The cruiser is like a castle of the Sleeping
Beauty. In the labyrinth of ladders, doors
and passages, black holes alternate with the
shadows from dim lamps. On each side of the
corridors are the rows of closed doors leading to
the cabins where the officers and the boatswains
toss between insomnia and bad dreams. A smoky
light reveals the suspended hammocks. After
their hard work the sailors fling themselves down
there and sleep just as they fall; their dangling
hands and knees are covered with coaldust; many
of the faces seem masked in black.</p>

<p>At the staircase to the engine-room, the fireman
and swabbers (soutiers) tumble out pell-mell on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
the metal floor, too exhausted to lift themselves
into their hammocks. One has to be careful not
to step on someone’s chest or ear. The ship
could go down, and these men would not wake
from their stupor. Some of the more fastidious
ones have taken the trouble to procure a pillow;
it is a lump of coal, very hard and dusty; their
cheeks press it as softly as if it were of down.</p>

<p>With outstretched hands and hesitating feet,
the officer makes his round, runs into something,
and stops. He passes the watchers, the gunners,
the sentries. Wrapped in his cloak, and leaning
against the breech, a pointer is observing the
flight of the gray water through a port hole. His
eyes are wide open, but what can be the reveries
of this man who every day and night for so many
months has watched the gliding of the water?</p>

<p>“Well, Kersullec, it’s tiresome! You are almost
through!” whispers the officer.</p>

<p>“Yes, Captain. It isn’t that I’m not sleepy, but
I’ll hold out the rest of my fifty minutes.”</p>

<p>And further on:</p>

<p>“You’ve got your eyes open, eh, Le Bihan?
You know that yesterday evening they signaled
a submarine.... Quite near....”</p>

<p>“Let it come, Captain. It will see if Le Bihan
sleeps on his watch!”</p>

<p>Reaching the ward-room, the officer takes off
his cloak, his muffler, his gloves, and puts down
his glasses. He nibbles a crust of bread or refreshes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
himself with a drop of wine. The room is in
disorder from the preceding evening, with newspapers
left on the red sofas, games on the green
tables. One turns the pages mechanically without
reading, and shuffles the dominoes and cards
without thinking, and before going back to his
dull bed, one casts a glance at the betting-book.</p>

<p class="right"><i>22 March.</i></p>

<p>A happy find, this betting-book, which has
banished acrimonious disputes from the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>!
For since in this war our prophecies
about to-morrow or next week have nothing to
base themselves upon, what good does it do to
argue? If one of us, through some revelation,
acquires a definite opinion on future events, he
writes it in this notebook with the date, the hour
and the place. The page is divided into two
columns, one for, and the other against the prediction;
the man who bets proposes the stake. The
other signs in the right column or the left, and
when the bet falls due, the bad prophets pay up
as gracefully as possible. There is no opportunity
for contradicting, and it is much more amusing
than all the discussions.</p>

<p class="right"><i>30 March.</i></p>

<p>This morning, towards four o’clock, I signed
my name in the column of the most recent bets.
Here are the three wagers which interested me:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>Friday, March 26. 8.50 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> at 38° 11´ N. and
16° 11´ E.</p>

<p>M. X.... bets that within three months Italy
will be at war, but not Roumania. Stakes a dinner
in Paris in 1917, for which the winner shall choose
the restaurant and make up the menu.</p>

<p>The page of this wager is scribbled over with
emendations and remarks. The number of signatures
in the two columns is equal. The winners
will be awkward in their triumph.</p>

<p>Sunday, March 28. Midnight: at 38° 02´ N. and
18° 7´ E.  M. J.... bets with M. Z.... that the
Viviani ministry will not last out the year 1915.
Stakes: the two bettors being unmarried, the loser
agrees to act as groomsman at the marriage of
the winner, who agrees to choose him a pretty
maid of honor.</p>

<p>The page is sprinkled with facetious comments.
To tell the truth, I do not know which are wittier,
those which mention the wager, or those which
discuss the stakes. Between the fiancée and the
Premier, the maid of honor, the winner and the
loser, it is all humor of the cleverest kind.</p>

<p>Tuesday, March 30. 2.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> at 38° 10´ N. and
16° 23´ E.  M. W.... wagers that inside of a
month one of the seven Ionian cruisers will be
sunk by a submarine and lost without anything’s
being saved.</p>

<p>For this wager I see neither any stake nor opposing
signature.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span><i>4 April.</i></p>

<p>For seven weeks I have not been off the cruiser,
but this morning I was given a new duty; namely,
to land during our coaling; my turn has come to
provide the food for my twenty-five comrades of
the mess.</p>

<p>At no time is this a pleasant business; during
our war campaign it requires an angelic patience,
for supplies are difficult to get and the quality
uncertain. Each one of us watches without enthusiasm
the day approach when he becomes the
scapegoat for the dyspeptics and those with ailing
livers. But the implacable schedule, drawn up by
lot before our departure from Toulon, appoints
a new “chief of the mess” every two months.</p>

<p>You housekeepers who complain of the price
of provisions and the bad quality of the eggs had
better take passage on the ships which move in
the Ionian Sea, and you will learn about unknown
miseries. It is no mere question in our latitudes,
of varying the menus, of serving such a fish or
such a meat, nor even of calculating almost to
a half pound what will feed the household without
waste. The task is more difficult.</p>

<p>For fifteen or twenty days the cruiser has kept
to sea without quitting it; she has done her coaling
outside and has not revictualed anywhere.
Fresh provisions are a mere memory; eggs, preserved
in straw or lime, acquire with each meal
a richer and more vigorous flavor. The wine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
shaken about in warm casks, ferments. The fresh
water absorbs the rust of the iron-casks, and
tastes like the mephitic beverage of some invalid
resort. Our bread is heavy and indigestible, for
the bakers are seasick and the flour is mouldy.
For dessert we nibble some empty or frost-bitten
walnuts, dried raisins, excessively dried, and almonds
which either cannot be cracked or are filled
with powder.</p>

<p>Despite our work and weariness, we push aside
these pitiful refreshments sweetened with coaldust.
Our teeth crack lumps which have no taste of
vanilla; these are cinders which have got into our
sauces. Morning and evening we have to face
one or two dishes of beef. And such beef! Battered
by the wind and spray, tossed by the rolling
of the ship which bruises their tender nostrils,
the poor animals of the shambles trample listlessly
the steel deck and sniff their fermented hay
listlessly. After a few days at sea they have lost
their fat. They have to be killed in time, for fear
they will die during the night. For this maritime
agony they avenge themselves upon our teeth;
their flesh is like a ball of discolored twine, with
the pleasant elasticity of rubber. I will not
describe the chickens which survive a few weeks
of the cruise. I should need the vocabulary of
a cordwainer.</p>

<p>And then, in their distant campaignings, the
sailors habitually provide themselves with some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
digestive or rheumatic complaint, which is quiet
enough in hours of prosperity, and revives exactly
at the moment when one wants to keep well. Seven
entire months at sea under this régime have resurrected
all these ailments. The martyrs require
a light but nourishing diet of good food. Where
can we get it? The chief of the mess cannot
transform into fresh eggs these shells in which
are stirring chicks anxious to hatch out, nor into
fresh milk the viscous compound which comes
in metal cans. Musty cakes, greenish purées,
coagulated rice, become more and more common
on our plates. Complexions become yellow, features
drawn, and good-humor vanishes. Discussions
on the war or the service turn bitter. Those
who are endowed with unbroken health take the
diatribes philosophically: “Take it easy, my poor
friend,” they think. “Take it easy. I would
reply to you, if it wasn’t only your enteritis that
is speaking!”</p>

<p>One night a wireless arrives from the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>“You will coal Wednesday at Dragamesti, with
the cargo-boat <i>Marguerite</i>.” It is only Sunday,
but a smile appears on a thousand faces. The
whole cruiser takes on the alert pace of a horse
which sniffs the relay. A sorry relay however!
From morning to evening, in a harbor where the
wind blows violently, the ship will be shrouded in
coaldust; the sailors will wear themselves out, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
officers shout themselves hoarse trying to hurry
the filling of the sacks, and we shall leave more
exhausted than at dawn, for fifteen or twenty days
of pilgrimage. But we shall have made a halt.
Sailors in any part of the world, you will all understand
me!</p>

<p>The chief of the mess is happy, but becomes
anxious. Between two watches he has a conference
with the cook and steward. Both are
neurasthenic; it is as disagreeable to them to prepare
our little meals as it is to us to swallow them.
But hope, invincible in the heart of man, cheers
the trio:</p>

<p>“Captain,” says the steward, “buy some figs,
some salad and some fresh cheese. That will improve
the menu for a week.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replies the captain chief of the
mess. “But shall we find any?”</p>

<p>“I want some lambs,” demands the cook, “some
fish for two or three days, and if I can lay my
hand on a good fat sheep, I can guarantee that
you gentlemen will be satisfied.”</p>

<p>“All right. But I’m afraid we shall not find
very much.”</p>

<p>“And then, I must have at least four hundred
dozen eggs. The last time we only took two
hundred; a good half of them were rotten, and
we use six to seven dozen a day. So, in twenty
days....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“Oh! But, great heavens, my friend! Where
am I to get the money?”</p>

<p>For it is a fact: in war times, and in almost
impossible regions, the sailors have for their pay
and food not a cent more than in times of peace.
Upon this detail the chief of the mess has his own
opinion, but keeps it to himself. Pencil and
memorandum in hand, he wavers between fear
of overspending his credit, and of incurring the
anathema of his comrades. He opens his till and
counts the notes and change, closes the lock with
a sharp click and murmurs:</p>

<p>“I shall never get away with it....”</p>

<p>Monday and Tuesday pass. The general satisfaction
increases. The furrows deepen on the
brow of the chief of the mess. To-morrow is
Wednesday, the fatal day. But at dusk another
wireless message arrives:</p>

<p>“Collier <i>Marguerite</i> delayed by bad weather.
You will coal Thursday with the <i>Circe</i>.”</p>

<p>At this delay which desolates all the others, the
chief of the mess calms down and has a better
sleep. He has just gained twenty-four hours. But
his calm is shaken at table by the remarks which
unanimously agree that the food is uneatable—they
are right—and that the chief of the mess
ought to be hung. Poor chief of the mess!</p>

<p>A third wireless follows:</p>

<p>“Remain in the third sector until next Saturday.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
You will coal Sunday at Santa Maura with
the <i>Bayonnais</i>.”</p>

<p>Horror and desolation! The language of sailors
is not unresourceful, but in desperate cases it
becomes magnificent. This is one of them. Rabelais
himself, the prince of truculence, would open
his ears wide to hear the sailors—ordinarily
civilized—comment on this third message. I dare
not reproduce these explosions, but will keep to
my hero, the chief of the mess.</p>

<p>The bitterest pleasantries have an end. Towards
sunrise the ship finds its way to the appointed
rendezvous and anchors there. I will not
say it is at Santa Maura, or on Sunday, or with
the <i>Bayonnais</i>. It may be with the <i>Biarritz</i>, at
Antipaxo, on the following Wednesday. We are
within neither a week or a hundred kilometers of
the original order, but the cruiser lies still, with
the collier alongside, and the crew have already
plunged into a cyclone of black dust. With his
pocket full, but with an anxious heart, the chief
of the mess, accompanied by his two acolytes,
reaches the shore in a steam cutter. There is
nothing but ten houses and a small church. The
horizon consists of solid rock, without a sign of
cultivation. At each step the hope of provender
diminishes. We touch the quay, if there is a quay;
when there is nothing better we run up on the
beach, and the trio makes for the cluster of houses.
Some Greeks with intelligent smiles and unintelligible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
language are always to be found to conduct
you to persons who will sell you eggs, poultry,
groceries or animals. They take your hand
and pull you by the sleeve. They show certificates
from another cruiser which has left the evening
before, and which, like the brigand she is, has
surely taken everything! After many muddy
puddles, many ruts, the three victims arrive in
front of the herd, the poultry-yard, or the baskets
of fruit.</p>

<p>I suspect the people of this region of having
founded along their coasts sanatoriums of
lymphatic sheep and tuberculous cattle. I suspect
them of cultivating boxwood and fusain, cutting
the twigs off with scissors, and calling them salad.
I suspect them finally when they sell eggs at eight
sous apiece, of wishing to give you your money’s
worth, and of setting odor above cheapness.</p>

<p>“If you want to see better animals, there is
another herd ten kilometers away, behind the
marshes.”</p>

<p>“In that island opposite, I know a man who
grows vegetables; go to him. It will only take
you three hours there and back.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you could find fresher eggs at my neighbor’s,
but he just left for the mountains last
night.”</p>

<p>The chief of the mess devotes forty minutes to
understanding these wily proposals. He has only
a few hours in this remote region, and before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
night he has to provide for the food of twenty-five
men for twenty days. Followed by the
steward and the cook, he perspiringly visits the
miserable shops and doubtful poultry-yards.</p>

<p>“We have no more figs or raisins. The Germans
bought them all three months ago.”</p>

<p>“Yesterday one of your ships took the finest
head of cattle. If you had only come the day
before yesterday!”</p>

<p>Hours pass, but they do not in the least improve
the quality of what we are offered. The agents
become more and more cunning as they press you
to buy, for they know that the cruiser sails at
dusk, and their kind souls fear she will leave without
provisions. In a creaking carriage or on a
broken horse, the chief of the mess goes to see
this herd, or that famous poulterer, and returns
with a desire to slaughter his guide. Evening
comes. The cruiser whistles, raises the flag of
recall, and is to put to sea in half an hour. We
must buy now, whatever the cost. Then pell-mell,
in sacks or boxes, under the goad of the shepherds,
on the shoulders of the boys, the eggs and suspect
vegetables, the consumptive animals and the
parchment poultry begin to move towards the
cutter. The Chief’s spirit is haunted by dark
presentiments, but he offers fresh blue notes and
new gold pieces in exchange for these precarious
victuals. The sons of Mercury wrangle over the
change and the price, the porters demand their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
tip, and the market becomes an uproar of invective.
But all that is nothing to what is in store
on board.</p>

<p>At last everything is in order. The cutter
leaves the quay, followed by pleasantries, and
arrives at the ship, which weighs anchor and begins
in the night its twenty days of cruising. In
answer to the questions of his comrades the chief
of the mess tries to put on a good face, but the
evening meal gives him a hint of the refined torture
he will endure until the next landing, and
he invokes the god of resignation to his aid.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This afternoon, since I had used up my store of
gold and silver, I gave a hundred franc note to
some breeder of elastic chickens. I owed him
fourteen francs. Instead of giving me back eighty-six
francs, he made the entire change for the note
in pieces of five, two and one drachmas. In the
midst of a crowd of boys and attentive men he
counted it, recounted it, and put it in my hand.</p>

<p>From these hundred francs which he gave me
I took out two five-drachma pieces and two two-drachma
pieces, making up the total amount. But
he returned me the two five-drachma pieces, and
I cannot describe the air with which he said to me:
“Your two coins are bad. Give me two others.”</p>

<p>If I had been a German, I should have knocked
him on the head. But I contented myself with
throwing the two coins into a pile of mud that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
happened to be there, and jumped into my cutter
without saying a word. As we returned, I examined
the other coins. They were sound. And
I could not help laughing, for if I had chosen two
good coins to pay him with, this good breeder
would have robbed me of ten francs.</p>

<p>I have traveled much, I have seen many swindlers;
but this one takes the first prize.</p>

<p class="right"><i><span class="padright">Strait of Otranto,</span><br>
25 April to 1 May, 1915.</i></p>

<p>The cruisers on the Ionian Sea have received
orders to go up as far as the Strait of Otranto.
Perhaps the Commander-in-Chief, who is stationed
towards the south of Greece, has learned
that the Austrians are preparing certain naval
operations and so sends us to watch the enemy at
closer range; perhaps this movement corresponds
to some play on the chess-board of war. Little
do we care. We leave these desert regions, and
go to find the friends of our early days: Santa
Maria de Leuca, Fano, Corfu.</p>

<p>Again we encounter their charms and their
graces. Autumn had decked them in soft colors;
April envelops them in a virginal light. At the
end of Italy the lighthouse of Leuca rises like a
marble finger always white; and the islands and
the mountains of Epirus are pink in the morning,
blue through the day, and mauve at dusk. The
air is so marvelously pure that the night itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
does not rob things of their color. Violets and
yellows remain, even under the moon.</p>

<p>We have plenty of time to admire these
beauties, already so familiar. The cruisers move
very slowly, for they must not use too much coal.
Several times we have been surprised to find one
of them wanting to hurry the schedule of coalings
and do its provisioning two or three days earlier.
So in order not to incur the reproach of stopping
oftener than is necessary, the cruisers have taken
a leisurely pace, and the consumption of fuel has
become satisfactory. Especially at night, in the
religious calm over which the hills of Corfu and
the lighthouse of Leuca watch as sentinels, it
seems that we are quite motionless.</p>

<p>The family of cruisers, which was formerly dispersed
over the Ionian Sea, now meet each other
continually, and play at puss in the corner. In
the course of a day one sees three or four gently
rise on the horizon, make a curve as they double
the edge of their sector, and nonchalantly depart
again. When they have something to say, two
comrades approach each other: the <i>Ferry</i> talks to
the <i>Gambetta</i> by wigwagging, the <i>Waldeck</i> to the
<i>Renan</i> with flags and pennants; through the glass
one recognizes friends; salutations are exchanged
by waving caps or hands. When the conversations
are finished, each one turns her back and
goes to patrol her watery field. Every morning,
from eight to nine o’clock, the ships signal information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
about the amount of coal remaining,
their daily consumption, the number of sick on
board, and the number of the sector they are
patrolling. If one of them has done or sighted
something interesting, she mentions it. We have
a little daily chat; thanks to which we feel less
lonely—within reach of a voice, so to speak. During
their watch the officers consult the memoranda
of the wireless messages, and read hastily the news
from their neighbors, just as one listens, without
paying attention, to the friend one meets in the
street who gives one the bulletin of his family’s
good health.</p>

<p>We have, moreover, plunged back into the great
road of international traffic. Again the throng of
steamers, freighters or sailing vessels, passes
along the Italian and Greek coasts. We may not
go too near them, for fear of penetrating the territorial
waters, and of thus finding Italy or Greece,
with whom the Entente is carrying on negotiations,
touchy about their sea frontiers. If one of
the cruisers visits some ship too near the limit,
she is accused of having overstepped the line, and
the affair, exaggerated, becomes disquieting.
Better to evade the controversial line, and only
accost, with a clear conscience, the ships that risk
themselves on the high sea.</p>

<p>In order that the crews may not lose their skill
in firing the guns, which sleep in a profound
slumber during this disconcerting war, from time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
to time we practise firing at floating targets. Not
shooting with a regular charge, for our guns make
so much noise that an hour later all the telegraphs
of the world would announce “the great naval
battle in the Strait of Otranto,” but what is called
in the navy reduced firing. With small charges
and small shells we fire upon little canvas targets
which float on the water like children’s toys
driven by the breeze. This makes proportionately
no more noise than a pea-shooter firing peas, but
the entire organism of the ship—engines, system
of direction and of firing, telemetry and rules
of firing—functions as it would in battle. When
we pick up the target the crew examines the
canvas and the framework, counts the holes and
the scratches, criticizes this parody of battle. A
pitiful solace for our desire for action! One
thought consoles us: the Austrians at Pola, the
Germans at Kiel, the English in the bases where
they wait, are tiring themselves with the same
vanities as ourselves, with reduced firing and the
pretences of battle. Yes, this naval war is indeed
disconcerting.</p>

<p>These were my thoughts during the watch the
other night, when everything about me was so
fair. A full moon with soft features, but with
a contour as sharp as that of a new medal, rode
in a sky as pure as the face of a child. The stars
were swollen with joy. Vague lightning illuminated
first one part of the sky and then another,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
like vagrant smiles of the night, without
arrière-pensée. The sea, drowsy with warmth,
had a calm and fragrant breath, and it seemed
as if our prow in cutting it was profaning a divine
slumber. It was one of those moments when the
most unhappy man feels love flood his heart, and
as my eyes fell only on eternal things, my spirit
absorbed all their blessing. The cruiser was
patrolling the middle of the Strait of Otranto; on
its left a comrade kept guard towards Fano and
Corfu; on its right the <i>Gambetta</i> in the Italian
sector received from time to time the flashes from
the lighthouse. During the afternoon we had
come quite near the <i>Gambetta</i>; our boats had exchanged
the parcels, the mail, and orders, and it
is now the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> who will occupy the
Italian sector after we separate. At the last moment
some new order has given our place to the
<i>Gambetta</i> and kept us in the central rectangle.
It is of no particular importance, and our turn
to be neighbors with the lighthouse will come
to-morrow.</p>

<p>I shall not try to describe the train of thought
which haunts the officer of the watch when nature
becomes kindly again and accords him a respite
for his body. As he surveys the sea with unrelenting
eyes, he makes the tour of the weather,
of the world, of his ideas. The fluttering butterfly
is less capricious than this reverie of his,
but he rests at last on some flower of thought. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
remember that on this night, towards the third
hour of my watch, I was thinking of the contrast
between the peace of Nature and the human agony
of the war. I had taken off my cap to feel the
caressing fingers of the night; I had even opened
my vest, and felt almost on my skin the freshness
of the reviving breeze. On the sea, so light that
it seemed transparent, I saw nothing in particular;
but that was undoubtedly the weakness of my
vision, the fatigue from too long cruises, the lassitude
which on this night all my comrades of the
watch on the cruisers felt with me. Otherwise
my mind was clear.</p>

<p>The work of France and Russia, the enterprise
of the Dardanelles and Gallipoli, all that had not
been done, all that could be done, and ought to be
done, everything defined itself in precise images.
Around the cruiser was so much silence and so
much silent light that my thoughts seemed to
speak aloud to me. When my successor came to
replace me on the watch, I quickly told him all
the routine things, and then remained several
minutes before going down to my cabin, in order
to enjoy the marvelous night for a little while
longer. There was not a single sound or light,
and I left the bridge regretfully. I thought of
the officers of the nearby cruisers, towards the
right and the left of us, several miles away, feeling
the same sensations, and I was consoled.</p>

<p>The arriving day brought dazzling beauty after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
the quiet charm of the night, but everything
around the cruiser remained the same—calm,
silence, warm air. After a heavy sleep, a listless
morning and a short meal, I resumed at noon the
interrupted watch. The same thoughts continued
to accompany my duties. Between them there
was only the difference of moonlight and sunlight.
My reasonings were clearer, my rancor stronger,
but the sparkling of the waves revealed nothing.
As we had nothing to communicate to the cruisers
on our right and left, we remained quietly in the
center of our sector, and my only companions of
the watch were the sun, the migrating birds and
some dolphins in the water.</p>

<p>Towards two o’clock I received the sudden news
of the death of a sailor on board. The news tore
me from my peaceful mood. I know that in this
far place the death of one man does not count,
especially when one is acquainted with that man
only by a number. Yet I could not refrain from
a certain melancholy, and the train of my reveries
became somber. You poor little sailor, who has
given up his life in this iron prison, where will
be your grave? The perfumed rocks of Greece,
or the sands of Apulia, or a shroud in the Ionian
deeps? Wherever it be, no hand will ever strew
flowers on your white wooden cross, and those
who write you to-day perhaps will not know to
what part of the vast world they should direct
their tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>To the end of my watch I keep thinking of this
destiny of the sailors, who do not even halt to die.
Around me the faces of the lookouts and gunners
show the same aspect of gravity which mine
should have. This morning, it seems to me,
touches us more than it should. Is there not going
on somewhere a drama much more terrible?</p>

<p>In order to banish such reflections, I go to look
in my cabin for my little dog Jimmino, with his
cold nose, his soft eyes and silky hair. Since my
last stay in Malta, he has exchanged the ease of
his mistress’ home for the hard existence of a
ship. At night he sleeps in the hollow of my
shoulder, and when he wakes, he watches my
slumber without stirring. When I work, he whines
softly until I lift him up on my desk. He puts
his head between his paws, and follows the course
of my pen. He does not like me to remain too
long without speaking to him, for I think he is
of a jealous temperament. In order to let me
know he is there, Jimmino rises and walks across
my pages where his paws trail thick threads of
ink. Then I give him a little tap on his cold nose
and scold him:</p>

<p>“Get away, you horrible, badly brought up
little thing! What would your mother say if
she...”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” replies the little tail as it wags.
“You have spoken, silent master, and you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
struck me; so you must love me. I am not vexed
with you any more.”</p>

<p>Jimmino lies down again within reach of the
paper, his nose so near the sheets that at the end
of every line I feel his warm breath on the back
of my fingers. He watches my bent head, and
thinks:</p>

<p>“I know very well you are bored, and that you
brought me with you to distract you. I am very
happy when you deign to think of me. But do
you suppose that I am amused? Formerly, I
played with the cat, on the stairs, under the furniture,
and around the kitchen. Everything smelt
good all around, and they washed me every morning.
Here everything is full of coal and bad odors.
The moving sea makes me dizzy. And then I have
become the dog of an officer, and cannot go with
the crews’ pets. What have I done that you should
exile me? Listen to me, silent master. Speak
to me.”</p>

<p>The paw stretches out cautiously to the edge
of my freshly written line. “Back, Jimmino!
You will make a bad blot!”</p>

<p>The paw draws back.</p>

<p>“Bah! You are right,” the master goes on.
“It is late. In a quarter of an hour we shall eat.
Come up on the bridge. We will take the air.”</p>

<p>I take Jimmino, warm and soft, up on my
shoulder, where he weighs nothing. He settles
himself, snuggles against my ear which he tickles.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
He trembles at my rapid course along the corridors,
up the companion ways, to the height of
the bridge.</p>

<p>The twilight is marvelous with its soft and
delicate shades of color.</p>

<p>“What news?” I say to the officer of the watch.</p>

<p>“Nothing.... The same old story.”</p>

<p>“Any interesting messages?”</p>

<p>“None! Communiqués from Eiffel, Norddeich,
Poldhu. The cruisers have nothing to say. Go
read the memorandum.”</p>

<p>I hasten to read the book of telegrams, glancing
over the hundred or two hundred messages of the
day. It is the same strain as yesterday, and as
it will be to-morrow. “Left Navaria at 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,”
says this one. “I count on finishing coaling this
evening,” says another. “I am on my way to
Bizerta,” says a third, and so on for four pages.</p>

<p>“Well,” says the officer of the watch. “You
see there is nothing.”</p>

<p>“It’s queer. The <i>Gambetta</i> has not spoken
to-day.”</p>

<p>“There was probably nothing to announce.”</p>

<p>“It should have signaled its daily position this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Wireless damaged perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. All the same it has said nothing
since 9 o’clock last night.”</p>

<p>“Have any of the cruisers called her?”</p>

<p>“Yes! And she has not responded.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“You are sure?”</p>

<p>“Go and see. I will watch in your place.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later my comrade returns, after
running over, examining and considering the four
pages of messages.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he says. “It is strange.
However, nothing has happened to her. She
would always have had time to signal S. O. S.
That doesn’t take two seconds.”</p>

<p>“That’s true. But all the same, she should
have replied to the ships that called her.”</p>

<p>“She was wrong. We shall see to-morrow.”</p>

<p>I go down to dinner. On my chair Jimmino,
crouched like a sphinx, is waiting for bits from
my meal. Our assembly is not very noisy. We
comment upon the end of the day, and the doctor
receives placidly the usual pleasantries. The conversation
turns listlessly on Turkish affairs.
Why is there no animation? The officers who are
going to take the watch rise to put on their uniforms
for the night. We greet them in the familiar
way as they pass out. “A good watch to you, old
man! Keep your eyes open!” “Don’t delay
us!” “You know I’m taking the Paris express
this evening.” “If you see a submarine try not
to waken me.” “And then,” I added, “let me
know if there is a message from the <i>Gambetta</i>.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“She has not spoken for nearly twenty-four
hours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>“The deuce!” murmured the assembly. “What
has happened to her?”</p>

<p>The game tables are set up, for dominoes, chess,
bridge; the smokers light their pipes; the readers
open their paper; others stretch out on the
cushions. Interpretations are offered concerning
the silence of the <i>Gambetta</i>.</p>

<p>“Accident to the wireless....”</p>

<p>“She had nothing to say....”</p>

<p>“She ought to have signaled her daily position....”</p>

<p>“She should have replied when she was called....”</p>

<p>“We shall see to-morrow...!”</p>

<p>The cards fall, the dominoes grate, the newspapers
crackle, and the pipes pull. All in this
little world are silent, absorbed in their game,
their reading or their reveries. But it is appearance
only. Yesterday afternoon we talked with
the <i>Gambetta</i>; last night she cruised in the sector
where we were to go. For twenty-four hours she
has been silent. In the cards, in the papers, and
the smoke from the pipes, each one of us reads
these disquieting thoughts. But no one speaks
of it. I go to bed, for I have to take the watch
again in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>Jimmino trots behind me, installs himself near
the pillow, and sleeps with a dreamless slumber.
But I await through the long hours some news of
the <i>Gambetta</i>. Eyes closed or open, I cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
escape being haunted by her. All my comrades
tell me they have passed a sleepless night.</p>

<p>In the shadow I go up to take the watch. My
predecessor repeats the sacred phrases. I interrupt
him:</p>

<p>“But the <i>Gambetta</i>?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe that...?”</p>

<p>I dare not finish. He dares not answer, but disappears
in the darkness.</p>

<p>I fix my eyes on this treacherous sea which
never gives up its secrets. An anguish with iron
fingers presses my heart. There is no more doubt
of it, death has passed over one of our brothers.
Each hour that slips by proves the magnitude of
the disaster, and if no news ever reaches us, it
will be because all at one stroke eight hundred
men will have plunged into the sea. Leaning on
the rail, I stroke the metal mechanically, and the
wood and canvas which meet my hand. I enjoy
feeling the good cruiser, alive and in motion,
quivering under me. I realize how much I love
her, and it seems to me, that in order to pierce
the darkness, my eyes take on the acuteness of
a father’s who scans the face of a child of his
that is menaced by death.</p>

<p>A little later our wireless operator sends me
a bundle of messages. With nervous fingers the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
ensign translator turns over his codes and dictionaries
in order to transform these ciphers into
French. Each minute I go to his shoulder to read
the line, or the half-line, or the word he has transcribed.
Heavens! How long it takes to spell
out the horror!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It happened yesterday evening, during that
fatal watch which I found so beautiful. The moon
was quite round; the sea was transparent, and
I saw nothing on it. Like me the officers on watch
on the <i>Gambetta</i> were weary of their useless
vigil; at the end of their route they saw the gleam
of the lighthouse at Santa Maria di Leuca. In
the distance passed the shadows which I should
have seen if the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i> had cruised
in the sector which it was to have had. These
shadows were ships going along the Italian coast.</p>

<p>But another shadow, covered by the water, had
been on watch for many days. It knew we were
going by way of the Strait of Otranto. Advised
by its accomplices, it awaited, motionless, the occasion
for striking a decisive blow. For three
nights, for four nights, the majestic cruisers
passed too far from this shadow submarine, from
this octopus with deadly tentacles. The moon, as
it approached its full glory, became more and
more luminous.</p>

<p>During these splendid hours, when I had almost
disrobed to feel the caresses of the night near me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
the submarine saw approaching a slowly moving
vessel, with four stacks and graceful outline. It
made ready, as it had the night before and the
night before that, and hoped that the ship’s
present route would permit it to cast its death
thrust.</p>

<p>What pen could describe this drama in all its
fullness?</p>

<p>On the <i>Gambetta</i>, sailors and officers scanned
this sea that was almost too bright; they had seen
it raging or seething with billows, or tormented
by the wind, or calmer than a sleeping eyelid. It
was the ninth month! Flashes of lightning dazzled
their eyes, and they moved, like the watchers on
the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>, in a confusion of gleams
and darkness. It was the two hundredth night!
They were weary. They had waited so long, they
no longer expected anything. Their eyes met only
illusion.</p>

<p>The submarine lay in wait in the bosom of the
waves. It knew that some time or other its
wonderful prey would pass within range of its
torpedo. Through the lens of the periscope its
commander saw the luminous circle where the
moon danced, the surface of the mirrored water,
and the phantoms which move in a night at sea.
He heard on the submerged hull the lapping of
the dark waves. All the sailors at their posts
watched the gesture of his hand and the sound
of his voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>Suddenly this man’s heart began to beat as if
it would burst. God of death, you were speaking
in his ear! He had just seen in the funnel of
his periscope two masts and four stacks. She
rose in the midst of the lightning flashes, a
phantom. Tense and still, the man asked himself
if the vision would approach, or would vanish as
on the preceding nights. She approached. She
came, a vagabond, predestined, without knowing
that a demon was plotting her death. With closed
lips and moist hands, this man prepared his
words. Twenty-five men watched him as if he
were a destroying angel.</p>

<p>At the given moment he said: “Fire!”</p>

<p>The torpedo left the submarine like a breath
in the water and as silently. For a few seconds,
a few endless seconds, it rushed through the echoless
water. Two flashes, three flashes, gleamed in
the sky; the lookouts on the <i>Gambetta</i> covered
their faces with their hands. They did not suspect
that this moment, which followed so many
other moments, held in it the last breath they
would draw.</p>

<p>Then a dull sound behind her made the cruiser
tremble. She was seized with a sudden fever, and
each of her metal plates resounded. Death spread
through her limbs and muscles. In through a
breach in her very heart rushed the dark water,
leaped and broke everything before it. What happened
then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>I do not know. I do not yet know. But some
of the messages make it possible to imagine the
details of the horror.</p>

<p>Filled with water on her wounded side, the
<i>Gambetta</i>, lurched toward her sea grave, and the
sailors who were not killed at once thrust out their
arms to save themselves. Everything slid around
them. To stand upright they had to lean over;
their hands had to serve them for eyes, for darkness
enveloped the cruiser. Naked and silent they
rushed on toward the deck, but the slanting companion
ways were now as perpendicular as walls.
How many unfortunates perished in their suddenly
interrupted sleep, without realizing that
their ship was going down for the last time?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On the deck, a black chaos! Each second the
cruiser sinks deeper. The gulf of the waves
grows larger, and each moment perhaps will be
the final plunge. By main force the sailors launch
the boats and the cutter, which drop into the
water wrong side or right side up. The officers
are calm and have put aside their fatigue; they
give the necessary orders for the rescue. In the
sky the two masts and the four stacks sink lower
and lower. The cruiser, with its apparatus
damaged, can send out no signal for help, and all
those who dwell on her plunge into the depths as
if down a silent stair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>A handful of men have been able to enter the
boats. Chilled, but struggling for life, they have
taken the oars, and during the last hours of the
night have rowed towards the friendly lighthouse.
At the first gleam of day, with bleeding hands,
but with a marvelous tenacity of will, they have
made a supreme effort, and the Italian customs-officers
take in sixty exhausted men almost at the
point of death.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>From Tarentum to Rome, from Rome to Paris,
from Paris to Malta, and from Malta to the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>,
this story of the drama has been
traveling for twenty-four hours. The good neighbor
we loved to see in our meetings on the high
sea has met the death which might have been
our own. She has disappeared without a word,
felled at the first stroke in an eddy of the sea,
as befalls her pilgrims. The wound was muffled
and dumb, for over there on the horizon I saw
nothing. One of the flashes that played in the
sky was perhaps the gleam of the torpedo which
killed her, but I was deceived by the illusion of
distance.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Without mourning or benediction they laid their
bodies in the cemetery of the sea. From Admiral
to midshipmen, all the officers are buried in this
sea, at once so maternal and malevolent. The
superhuman souls of these officers attempted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
impossible. They wished to save the cruiser, and
the cruiser went down. They wished to save the
men, and it is not their fault that nearly eight
hundred sailors perished.</p>

<p>And then, according to that law of the sea which
ordains that the officer shall wait until the last
sailor is saved, they went down with their ship.
The ignorant will criticize them, but they are
wrong. If each Frenchman, in civil or military
service, performs to the uttermost the task his
country demands of him, his country, with a heave
of her shoulders, will chase the Germans out of
France.</p>

<p>Officers of the <i>Gambetta</i>, you have your place in
the paradise of “<i>la Revanche</i>.”</p>
